The popular perspective claiming that French should only be spoken perfectly creates insurmountable barriers for those without fluency. I live in a country where I am not fluent in the dominant language and have to address this confusing mental block in order to survive. I hope others facing similar hurdles do the same.</p>

<p>Language may be accessed at many levels, but when I first saw French on a chalkboard, I was consistently overwhelmed. While I learned it quickly then, I did not feel much passion for it. Piece by piece, I now learn how to use the classroom vocabulary that I once wrote on worksheets for a red marker check. Whether it be mere interest or the ordinary pursuit of living well here, I have rekindled the fire to overcome the learning curve. I am not proficient nor do I possess the flexibility of good syntax, but I am getting things done, which is the most basic purpose of communication. What more could I ask for? Technically nothing, unless I can get a translator.</p>

My canvas shoes are wet and my hip pains me through every step. It is dusk on the third Thursday that I’ve been here in France. The overcast sky and watery streets creep into the cracked church and dampen the walls. Since they cannot force their way in entirely, I imagine this is the most dreary ambiance they can muster. The dominant colors around me are black and blue and stone gray. The chill and hollow empty space are causing the church to be blustery and cold. I kneel on the smooth rounded bar at my feet and let the discomfort in my bones distract the rest of my body from the cold. I reflect on the days that have passed.</p>

<p>I began this morning with appointments at LCL Bank and EDF Electricity. Finally some obligations to tend to! I’ve missed the feeling of structure that they give me. My life as a traveler is fine, but I greatly appreciate the feeling of purpose in a daily routine. Crossing the appointments off my list was rewarding. This Saturday I’m meeting with Enzo and some new friends for the Marseille-Evian soccer match. Next weekend I am either going to Grenoble or Milan. Separate groups are traveling to each respective city; we’ll see which one has their act together. Several American students studying in Paris, Lyon, and Marseille are planning a Valentine’s Day weekend trip to Barcelona. Birds of a feather eventually find one another on Facebook and make travel plans. After these 13 days of freedom from social chains, I admit it is nice to be back amongst humanity.</p>

<p>My mind is a treacherous place to be. Days and nights are so different and the life I want to lead seems like a distant fantasy. What am I to do if the problems I face are the very backbone of existence? I am like the church. The winds, the cold, the worldly dissonance are all pushing at the doors. I am inside trying my hardest to distract myself from it, kneeling before the altar with the single red candle.”</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>“I promised myself I would write something once I got to the top of the mountain. Here I am at 15:36 hidden behind a large jagged rock overlooking the water. The biting wind is painfully chilling the sweat on my back. Four hours on and off the trail got me to this point. I set out without a destination and I can’t imagine ending anywhere else but here.</p>

<p>With my camera, a scarf, two oranges, a water bottle, my journal, and a pair of sunglasses packed into my grey Jan Sport, I started up to the coast. I hiked past Martine’s and the line at her food truck, and then past the official at the park reserve offices. There was a vagrant hiker returning from his stroll. My contact with people quickly ended, however, once I hit gravel. The path was completely deserted for these next hours. I hiked and made progress toward the highest peak. I watched the path as it curved around the mountain, barely making progress toward the top. I saw it bend out of view and then return in the other direction 40 feet up the mountainside. This frustrated me. I wanted a straight line, something more direct toward the summit. I kept my heading on the compacted dirt for the sake of consistency. I left the path a few times to explore caves, lookout points, or challenging ascents. I lost my footing on the scraggly limestone gravel and cut my hands on stiff thorny bushes. They continually see me stumble and kick me when I’m down. They leave a tally on my hands for every time I fall</p>

<p>Atop one of the rock tables, I noticed a slight glimmer coming from the corner of a small exposed rock. I crouched down to inspect it and see some crystalline structure grown from pressure. I pessimistically assume this is not a stone of any value, but nevertheless I collect some nicely angled pieces in the palm of my hand and hold them. I am pleased to have been rewarded with these pale stones from my side-excursion. I carefully added them to my backpack. When I got back up, my footing was abruptly shifted by the coastal wind. I lifted my head and looked further to the side to see that three feet away was the edge of the table. I thought about how I could die here.</p>

<p>The descent is more dangerous than the climb. On the way up, gravity works as an equalizer and slows your pace against the mountain. Coming down, however, gravity works in the same direction as you do, resulting in an ease on your muscles. You accomplish more with less, your focus loosens, and before you know it, gravity pushes your slipping foot down and without a quick reaction, the rest of you will follow. If you aren’t careful, you fall down just when the path seems to get easier. You begin grabbing at anything to get yourself back up, even those damned bushes that cut your palms. Again, I think about how I could die here.</p>

<p>I continued on the main path and decided that for now, it’s okay to meander up the side of the mountain. It led me to views of Marseille and the Mediterranean Sea that I had never seen before. It gave me a tour of some neighboring cities far off in the distance along with several colorful rock formations jutting out into the water. This path was a challenge. It led me up and down the mountain and I didn’t reach the top until the very end of my trek. I faced a final large white ascent via meandering makeshift-stairs that steeply led me to the peak. Glancing between my footing and the path in front of me, disorientation slowed me down. My vision faded in and out as I made slow progress, but refused to stop. I was well aware of the danger.</p>

<p>Filled with adrenaline, I made the final step toward the highest surface. There are no trail markings around me. There are no paths and no people. Looking around, I notice the edge of the cliff with the sea before me. To my right lies a path back towards Luminy, and to the left is Cassis miles away in the distance. I notice a dark stone pillar standing about 6 feet high, but make nothing of it. I make my way toward the very edge of the rocky cliff to behold the water and the expansive horizon before me. I imagine reaching Africa beyond my side of the water. I am still for a moment.</p>

<p>I think about the world and begin to imagine myself from above. I see the coast, I see Notre Dame de la Garde, I see Marseille, and I see the Mediterranean countries. I cross water and land, then the entirety of the Atlantic Ocean, and I see Virginia. I am with my family and my friends; I think about how selfish it is for me to be abroad and alone. They need me and I want to be there for them. I am sad to think of what I’m missing, such as the celebrations and happy moments of my loved ones, including the harder moments. I am sad to be alone for this moment. For so long, I’ve been an advocate for independence and that being alone doesn’t make you lonely by default. Frankly, I am lonely up here on the cold mountain top, as if the presence of another would make it any warmer.</p>

<p>I am proud of where I come from and perhaps that is why I miss it. I pick up a hefty rounded rock with two hands and move to the edge. I want to be present for this entire journey; I want to rid myself of these thoughts that weigh me down. I let these negative thoughts leave my body by speaking my frustrations to the stone, listing names and intentions. I moved toe-to-toe with the edge of the cliff and yell as I hurl it as far away from me as I can. I look for the rock, but can’t see it once it drops beneath the edge. The pain in my throat remains.</p>

<p>I am beyond self-doubt and confliction. I am here and am wholly present. I remind myself that I am 20 years old and living and thriving alone in a new part of the world. These feelings of isolation were expected and aren’t surprising. I remind myself that my life is changing every day and that the sacrifices I made to my family are noble, coming from the best intentions. I am not in Marseille to escape the life I lead, but to learn and to be better for it. Down the road, this sacrifice will pay itself back.</p>

<p>The wind continues to keep me on my toes, correcting my balance as it precisely moves through the threads of my clothes onto my body. I shiver, look up, and see the sun peek through the clouds. My throat burns from the strain on my vocal chords. I welcome the pain because it is refreshing amidst the cold of the air pushing down on me. It’s a fire inside my body. I’ve given myself this warmth. I turn and walk in the direction of the stone pillar I noticed earlier, deep in thought. My eyes widen and stomach lurches when I realize that my next step will be into the air, off of the cliff. I think about how I could die here.</p>

<p>I correct my heading and look in the direction of the pillar. There is a metal grating across a recess in the front. I imagine some sort of alcove for a statue in a church. I’m not sure what it is. I stop in front of it to inspect the thick, round structure and find a rope keeping the gate shut. I untie the gate, gently move it open, and see a rope hanging down the middle. I look down into the hole and am confused by the depth of the blackness. The noise of the wind stops. I can feel the sun completely. I retract my head from the stones and see that the trees are still. I turn back towards the object in front of me. It’s a well. I’ve never seen one before and stare as if it’s some fantastic thing from a child’s story. I pull on the thin coarse rope until a dented metallic bucket comes up. Echoes from falling water bounce off of the stone walls. I set the bucket on the sill and look at it, observing its familiarity, smooth sides, and dull metallic marbling. I touch my fingertips into the water and make the sign of the cross on my body. The wind comes back with vengeance and nudges the bucket off the sill. I catch the rope and lower it back into the hole, close the grating, and turn to hike back in the direction of Luminy. The sun is nearly gone and it will only get colder.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>I bought my train ticket and made plans to get to Avignon yesterday evening. It was a spur-of-the moment decision, the likes of which I don’t normally make. I stress myself out.</p>

<p>I found some comfort in the tight schedule I made. I planned out every minute from wake at 5:30 until 23:00. Throughout this trip, I would cross out my trophy schedule line by line and taped it to my wall in remembrance of another slightly greater, successful venture. When I pull into the city across the Rhone River Bridge, I see the city’s outer ramparts and the Palais du Papes towering above the city’s dull orange tiled roofs.</p>

<p>Mass was in the Avignon Basilica. The golden altar, the oil paintings, the stained glass, the incense, the language, the sounds of the organ and its single unfortunately detuned key used only in the recessional hymn, culminated to an oddly memorable and transportive experience. The day, like the city, pairs modernity and history in a way that is entirely unique to Avignon. In the blue-orange morning light, I explored the Palace of the Popes which is surrounded by 14th century architecture. I am impressed by the power of the Church, its ability to influence daily life, and its ability to make me feel small; to remind me that I am single being among many. Like ants piling dirt, this massive palace was built by 850 people in 20 years. Each individual’s story and strength are more than mine, and yet all these differences came together to build one brilliant monument that attempted to glorify God. I reflect on the radical movements in music that the Church inspired at the time; specifically, Guillaume de Machaut and Francesco Landini’s push for the new arts and polyphony. I think about living in a world centered around the Church. It’s a theoretically beautiful idea, but when I apply it to reality, I am conflicted</p>

I sit at the back of this space against the wall on the bench made for people like me. My eyes move through the emptiness before my feet, filling in the floor as it would have been 800 years ago. My senses are intrigued by the deep colors and glimmering gold, the smell, the sun sifting through the stained glass and dusty air, the fabrics and feel of the hundreds of holy vestments. I look at myself. Who would I have been? Could I have made it here in this building? Is this someplace I would even want to be? The contingency of another lifetime leaves me only with questions. I see the crowds of people who are truly holier than I lined towards the altar. I see the bishops, cardinals, and then the Pope at this time, Benedict XIII. I hear choirs singing praises to the heavens. How many of them acknowledge and appreciate the blessing they’ve been given? Music changes hearts, and yet the mouths the voices come from sometimes leave their own unchanged. I see design, hierarchy, and human next to human piecing together one body. This is one body built from many, and I no longer wonder where my part is in it. I am small. I am an outsider here, an observer to some extent. I watch and I see through the crowd. Their bodies no longer affect my experience, for this room holds only space now. I see You at the front and myself at the back.</p>

<p>Here, in this lifetime, at this year, and in this moment, there is nothing but a stone floor between You and me.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>I spent the second half of the day with new people. I’m a young American armed with a camera who relies on charisma and spontaneity. One photo-op that I couldn’t pass up resulted in my meeting Morgan and Bolgarov right outside of the city walls. They were on their bikes in front of the stone city ramparts. I saw them marking up the garden terraces and modern cement underpass near the highway. They welcomed my camera and my simple French.</p>

<p>Morgan excitedly took me around the gardens and shared the lines he had been working on. He and his bike moved like I had never seen before. He managed to get up on a 5-foot planter, balance on a thin ledge, and then cleanly get back down. Since I was too surprised to take a decent photo, I could only look at him wide-eyed with a goofy smile on my face. I let him know that I missed the shot, and so he and I toured the grounds, while Bolgarov practiced near the wall. Both of them consistently surprised me. We began as three, but before I knew it others were joining us, hopping out of cars on the highway and from behind the wall to meet up with us. We were eight by the end of the night, moving from spot to spot in the city laughing, taking photos, talking, and asking questions about one another. At the square in front of the palace, a friend was waiting with a Spanish guitar, a cajón, and a puppy — a good combo if you ask me. We played music and sang just like back home. I felt comfortable, especially considering that I am way off of my schedule.</p>

<p>The sun set, it got cold, and I wanted to eat. They wanted McDonald’s and I did not. I did not come to Europe to pay 10 euros for a Big Mac when I could get a great bottle of wine for the same price. Before I left the group for my meal, we connected on Facebook, said our goodbyes, bises, and did that French double-tap handshake that I still don’t think is that cool.</p>

I know my capabilities and after perceiving the problems ahead, I prepare myself as well as I can before the next obstacle overwhelms me. I grow because I fear being at the mercy of the waves.

I write from the inside of a cell. The image of my face is reflected on the glass pane that covers one of the doors of a Gestapo detainment block. Two artists have been at work on this medium. The prison walls have the dingy defiled characteristics only Time has the patience to carve. The other man inside whom I’ve grown to admire, has left his mark over Time’s signature. Letters, words, calendars, and drawings are engraved now in both serious and cynical detail for the world to see.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Time is torture and it is more than the physical torment this man endured. Time does not feel fatigued, Time has no schedule. Time, the ruthless limiter, pushes you from moments of happiness and enjoys the slowness of misery. You stand in the middle of the dark space you have for a mind. The dimensions are your choosing, but ultimately the measurements around you are irrelevant; the shade meets you wherever you choose to stand. He or she, the androgynous phantom, approaches the noisy iron and wood door at the front. The door cracks. You see light race past the tall silhouette towards you. Burning in your mind, burning in your temples, you close your eyelids until your lashes filter it out. The being arches its back to walk through the frame, it closes the door, and is lost for a moment in the darkness of your consciousness. Your eyes, now open, are relieved not to know its whereabouts. You don’t want to know and at the same time you do. At least you think you do. 
And so you do. In dull golden garb, a foot steps into the white light around you, followed by its torso and countenance, filled in with shadow. These moments pass slowly. These movements, the steps toward you, take years. Your breath fluctuates. In your emptiness, you gasp for air and in consolation you relieve your seams before they tear. Cloth dangles from the arms of the creature. It begins to move up toward you. It defies the gravity that pushes it down and in a way that is too fluid for the gaunt and lanky body parts in front of you. Its boney black hand settles on your shoulder. You stare for a moment, chained by fear, and look into the ambiguous visage facing you now. What barely resembles a face stares through your eyes into the back of your skull. Its calloused and rough hand slides to the base of your neck. You feel it on your skin rising up to your head. Nail leads finger into ear. You’ve gone unconscious and time moves on without you.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>I stand at this door and see a face reflecting back at me in the spaces between iron bars. I can only see the bottom of his nose to the top of his shoulders in this small gap. There is not enough detail to tell clearly, but it causes me to question on which side of the door it is that I stand. I am connected to this man although I don’t recognize him through the window. I know him through his writing, his carvings and this connects us. He writes to create a world outside of his own. He writes to turn time away and for reasons only he can truly understand. I write to capture the thoughts and the details of the moments time takes away from me. I want to remember the way I think now.</p>

<p>Although our words are different, both escape the threats of death and traps of time. You learn from me and I’ve learned from you. What’s more, I’ve been inspired by you. I admire you although I don’t know you. Similar and so different. I see your cause and I carry the message forward. I carry your mind and your nameless intelligence. Your pride and your devout servitude are relevant especially now. The man turns to leave the window and we go our separate ways.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>My relationship with my new peers is unique and unlike any that I’ve ever had before. I barely speak French and they barely speak English. A large amount of the words we use back home are unknown to the non-native, and often are not even used in the way that their definition suggests. I notice something similar here. There is a point where we begin to bend the rules of what our words mean and our emotions move the messages in between the lines. Colloquialisms fill in the spaces our words decorate. Neither side has this luxury anymore if they hope to get their point across. We are often limited to the most basic vocabulary and must present ideas in the most honest way. This is the result of honest relationship building. There is no mincing of words or annotating of speech bubbles here. We present what we have, stripped of all hidden agendas. For my overly-active mind and socially anxious self, this has been an unexpected breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>There is something to be said for the exchange students from the States as well. There is a strong sense of alignment between us—an acknowledgement that we are all up against the same difficulties and are just trying to piece together these accented vowels and backwards adjectives.</p>

The windows are open to the chilly red night sky and I hear the street sounds below. I’m cooking with Lucas while Brent fills glasses of wine across the two joined tables we pushed together. It’s loud and there’s music in the background.</p>

<p>I found a spot in this group while writing at the port in Marseille. They are all kind enough, and have personalities that pique my interest. Tomorrow we will ski the French Alps together, but some will be more successful at it than others. For now, I will enjoy a wide conversation that is friendly enough, but laced with sharp opinions. Strong patriotism exists, but I’ve not been convinced that it’s warranted at such an emphatic level. Maybe this is just my ignorance shining through.</p>

<p>Although we’re tightly squeezed into this kitchen, the conversation flows naturally despite our very apparent differences.</p>

The surroundings alternate between wide open moonlit fields and condensed black within tight concrete tunnels. The wind pierces my ears when we dive under the countryside hills. There is intense pressure on my eardrums as we enter and exit. My eyes are itchy. My throat is dry. I’m tired. I’ve been skiing, eating, laughing, and becoming more thankful for sleep day by day. I’ve been anxious and reluctantly annoyed, which means I’ve made friends as well as some acquaintances. I’m proud of the way I’ve handled myself throughout each of these situations.</p>

<p>I’m excited to get back to my apartment and unpack my souvenirs from Grenoble. They include the pile of emerald green broken glass, a well-designed 2014–2015 tourism guide, the winter issue of BeStreet magazine, evergreen from the top of the French Alps, ivy from the base of the Bastille, and several other smaller papers and posters from around the city and the Musée Dauphinois.</p>

<p>Another tunnel…</p>

<p>The shrill sound numbs my brain and breaks my concentration. I wish I had been able to find a gift for my mother because seasonal French retail sales are happening now. I’ve only got a few days until they end. The dark night and romantic speckled stars pass from my view.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>The bus pulls into the station and the city is still dark. My mind is blurry from the wildly disorienting late night ride from Marseille. I spent yesterday in my apartment slowly working on a presentation concerning the broad topic of ‘leadership.’</p>

<p>I get off the bus in groggy disarray from a cold’s onset and from 9 sleepless hours in a cramped space. My pursed eyes and scratchy throat are making it difficult to enjoy my arrival to Barcelona. I step down and pass a few other riders while I look for a place to sit, recuperate, and pull together a plan for when the sun rises. I cross the horseshoe-shaped cobblestone bus bay, under street lights that are notably different from the color I remember back home. These are gentler and have a warmness about them that isn’t so abrasive against the sleeping world. I enter through a slow-to-react automatic door and sit down for a moment. It isn’t long before another rider from the bus promptly approaches me and extends her hand for an introduction.</p>

<p>Becca is from San Francisco and is taking courses in Aix-en-Provence, majoring in French and anthropology. She is 20 years old, finishing her Bachelor’s Degree in a total of six years, has her septum pierced, and wears clothes that befit a true frenchie. At heart however, Becca is a Californian, born and raised. She’s a photographer and I can tell she has quite the eye for it by the way she sporadically pulls out her camera. Needless to say, I’m excited to be meeting someone that looks like the kind of person I would choose to get to know. Diversity is important for a group, but every now and then it’s nice to relate to a person because of similarities and not differences. With no additional direction, we take to the streets. She talks well and thinks even better. Becca is a critic of all the external forces around her. Political oppression, humanistic causes, child labor, and material consumption; you name it, she’s thought about it. If she hasn’t, she won’t fib her way through or change the subject. If she doesn’t know, then she doesn’t know, and that’s easy enough for her to say. She is cautious of both the things she lets into her life and how those things represent who she is</p>

<p>In the dark, we search for food, criticize street art, and learn about one another. For a moment, the ‘east versus west coast’ debate flares but quickly gives way for the sake of civility. I’m uninterested in this battle of bias and thankfully she is too. Since I’m unsure of how long our time together will be, I hesitate to offer the food I packed for today. Food is my best friend. As we walk I notice both of us mentally slipping, distracted by our stomachs. The conversation spreads and gets notably slower. Our steps up the hill push breath between our words. I cave and offer to share what I’ve packed for myself. We pick a bench in one of Barcelona’s many city parks to become our table.</p>

<p>A stagnant brass two-story fountain is to my left and another warm street light shines down on our wooden bench. We are in a closed-off bubble built from the brightness and shadow cast by the light above. Like looking out of a window at night, we can’t see out, but others can see in. We went back and forth about art, sociology, and our goals. She is kind and, within these first hours, I see admirable integrity.</p>

A moment like this happened as Becca and I sat on the bench having our breakfast. The washed-out blue morning sky slowly brightened and came into its own. At the apex of the sky’s change, the street lights in the park flicker off and, as if a curtain were raised, we were suddenly part of a much bigger and more colorful world again. I noticed the bikes, the dogs on leashes, and the man cleaning the concrete outside his store. Our conversation stopped for a time as we took in the change to our environment. It was a special moment that won’t soon leave my mind; an open invitation from the city, letting me know that the day had officially begun.</p>

Usually only after a hole has been completely filled do we give ourselves credit for the work we’ve done. Those who truly stop changing are to be pitied. Encourage them to work again. To be deprived of the ability to grow can be a side effect of the human burden. Push malignancy, self-deprecation, inadequacy, opposition, doubt, amateurism, and the always-important ego aside. See space not as what it isn’t, but what it could be. Embrace your ability to create something lasting for the world to one day stand before and look foolish gawking at</p>

I collect the last 5 euros from my pockets and set out to find dinner. As I make my way from store to store, I collect some seeded green grapes for €2.15, two Granny Smith apples for €1.15, and a crusty round loaf of bread for €1.20. I celebrate this small victory and welcome back the leftover 50 centimes to my pocket.</p>

<p>My path leads me across Barcelona’s Arc de Triomfe. With time to spare before my bus leaves at midnight, I step beneath the arch and into an area outlined by palm trees, ornate brass lampposts with more warm orange lights, and concrete benches. The rectangle-shaped plaza is filled with strolling couples, a few skateboarders, and dogs running free as their owners take back the daily tourist’s haven. I claim a bench, take off my shoes, cross my legs, and have my meal, ending the trip in a similar manner as I started it. This time there are a few differences, however, and the greatest is acknowledged as I speak to myself, panning across the docile cityscape.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>You are not asked to internalize the changes I inspire within you now. You are not asked to hold onto the victories you win here. You, Patrick, are called to act on them. You will build from stone and mind. The masses flock to celebrate our victory, interdependence in the flesh. You will make a monument that will stand for generations to come. The people that feel the least important carve their names onto your walls to feel remembered. These are the ones you seek to change. You give them this immaterial worth through the materials of your choosing. You will be the way for others to reach greater value. You will be remembered after you leave. I, myself, promise you that.</p>

<p>Only timidity keeps you from achieving your dreams. When you see the needy, your mind is the only obstacle keeping you from making a difference. I require your commitment to others and I, your conscience, won’t relent until you’ve stepped up to these obligations. I pull on your heart every time you turn down their suffering. You can change others; I’ve deepened your love and you can change their world.</p>

<p>Tonight you see what I mean. In darkness and frustration, a man with no teeth and no English will approach you. As you speak, he understands. Searching for something irrelevant, you are met with an opportunity to see the duality of our lives. Our choices can divide us. Some can turn their noses up and lift their cigarettes to their pursed faces. They air on worldly expectations and are callous. Ignorance is the most poignant form of degradation. Do not ignore those in need because you are meant to make the difference. You clear the smoke pushed out by selfish lips and show them how to love. Take this man in your arms, meet him with what you have, and lead him where you will. Change the toothless beggar and the stone-cold snobs.
Get close, get personal, get big, and be remembered. Memories of love change lives.</p>

<p>The bus on the way back to Marseille was just as bad as I expected. With a crooked neck and aching back, I made the commute to my apartment from the middle of the city. My first class of the week is in five hours.</p>

It is not an event, but a process requiring constant practice.

Only where such effort is expended is there life; where the effort ceases, life too ceases.”</p>

            </div>
                
            <div class="content_div"><p>Vacation has nothing to do with location. It’s a state of mind that I’ve been fooled by placebic palm fronds and a sea of new faces have done a number on my mind. I’ve fallen victim to the mirage of an empty schedule and, as if I’m crawling out of the desert begging for water, I beg to be alone. I dove deep into the pool and want nothing more than to climb out. For the entirety of February I’ve been making my way from bus, to city, to hostel, to dinner party, to bed, to an early rise, to food, and then repeat all with some changeable foreign entourage. Now, at the beginning of Lent, I pardon myself from these commitments to continue where I left myself off.</p>

<p>I’ve committed these next few days to more intimately understand my relationship with Marseille. The city has welcomed me so warmly, and yet every chance I’ve had, I left it to go to some other place. I owe it some level of attention and I get the feeling it’s been keeping so many things from me to discover. I’ve got this pearly city at my fingertips, yet I ignored it because of the familiarity of the word ‘home.’</p>

<p>It’s true, I’ve been entranced by the magic of food markets, French history, and the charismatic back streets in every city I’ve been in except for Marseille. The second largest city in France surely has these and more, but I’ve just been distracted from truly experiencing them.</p>

<p>I make the largest meal of the day, breakfast, (which has more dinner foods than breakfast foods) and commit to fasting for the rest of the day. I leave the apartment with only my camera in my backpack and spend the morning making my way through the art district which occupies the space between the Saint Charles train station and the port. I collect some rad carrots with a huge bundle of leafy green tops from the open-air shelves. Making my way inside the storefront where all the fruits are laid out, I find one of the owners hunched over an EDF electricity bill in front of the olive containers. Then an employee’s voice comes from the back room and offers to check me out at the register. I’m the only customer in the store. At the register, there are some bananas that are lumped into my purchase, but I’m still not sure how. I shrug it off because I like to think God knew that I was salivating and hard-pressed deciding between all of these fresh foods lining the streets. These thoughts passed quickly and I paid the extra euro plus some.</p>

<p>I excitedly come across a boucherie and step into the store, but not for meat necessarily. I pointedly search through the long glass cases and quickly pass the birds, pork, and beef. Although they look great, I was already given a banana by God. In the back where the unpopular items are, I find my prize: a sheep’s head. Five of them, actually, each for five euros. The skull is my trophy and finding it for this price is much better than I expected. A cleaned, prepped skull back home can sell for more than $50. (Side note, my entire transaction here was in French again; it’s good to be out of Spain.) He offers to cut the skull in half for me, to access the brain to eat. Quickly, and with a bit of fear in my voice, I tell him no. I consider the uselessness of a halved skull in my collection. He wraps the head and passes it to me over the glass display. I smile and skip to the register, a twinkle in my eye. I step down into the foot-path intersection just outside of the store and shade my eyes with my free hand.</p>

<p>My life suddenly is soundtracked by dopey synthesizers and vibrant primary colors as I spin, holding the head in both hands out in front of me. The smiley sun shines on the dancing tulips below. The growing patterns of tulips are irrelevant here in my shroom-like euphoria. Grinning like a twelve-year-old, I’m happy on a beautiful French afternoon. This excitement is so familiar and so different. Familiar because I think of Virginia and the rest of my bone collection, but different because I’ve got something to show for my venture out here to France. Marseille has officially made its way into the collection, like it belongs there and is officially a part of me. My interests and collections are part of me and the city has a place in my biography as well. I want to go home right now and begin cleaning the skull, but it’s only 13:00 and I remember my commitment to exploring Marseille today. I continue.</p>

<p>After I come down from my collector’s high, I put the head in my backpack and make my way downtown. On my way to wherever I am heading, I pass an intriguing pair of men living on the street. They are wearing high-laced boots, tattered fitted jeans, and embody indelible swagger. I don’t mean to be anything but honest here, but the piercings on their faces, the studs on their dingy jackets, and the hollow pins jammed through their hats made them look like friends already. “Bonjour Monsieur,” the one on the right happily offers. I look, nod, and smile. I pass and realize that I just found how I’ll spend the rest of the day.</p>

            </div>
                
            <div class="content_div"><p>I make my way through a grocery store collecting drinks, oranges, saussison, and pain au chocolate for the two homeless men I passed. As I’m writing this, I realize that I’ve picked out the foods I would have really liked to have eaten, which I’m sure has some metaphorical value. When I grab them quickly off the shelves, I recall my fast. I realize why I’ve been given that extra bunch of bananas as well. I put everything in one plastic bag and carry two large drinks in my hands. I put my camera away, fighting the temptation to capture their look in photograph. Two years of social justice education at my university has taught me to be especially intentional in situations like this. I am no savior. I return to their place and offer what I’ve brought.</p>

<p>Unsure of what language to begin in, I goofily hop between French and English and am relieved when English is fluently spoken back. When I eventually sit down with them on the concrete, I am careful to present myself as authentically as I can. I am not nervous because of them; I’m nervous because there is a gross stigma about people that live on the streets. It’s a barrier that puts them in a terrible light, as if they are some underground population of alter-races. I do my best to avoid these ideas as the conversation begins.</p>

<p>Ed, the more extroverted of the two, is the first to welcome me. His German face has over a thousand intricacies that tell the story of a lifetime. There is a scar or a deep wrinkle (I can’t quite tell which) on his skin that runs laterally across his face. His right nostril is pierced and he has ink just beneath his cheek skin in some befuddled shape that lost its corners with time. Both ears are crudely pierced and the stretched lobe on the left side has been torn from a fist fight. He tells me that a shark bone used to hang there from when he was fishing for sharks in Florida. Push came to shove, and he lost his job there nearly 11 years ago. When he was unemployed, he crossed the U.S. by foot in four and a half years. His wiry red beard thinly fills his face and his laugh is more of an alarming cackle. I’m not sure how the laugh came to sound that way over the years, but it seems as if it has taken time and intentionality to perfect. I never thought this laugh existed outside of TV.</p>

<p>Danny, the blued-eyed Dutchman, looks like God. The triangle made from his eyes and the metal bar that runs through the bridge of his nose makes the clearest window to divinity I’ve ever seen. In this moment, I begin to think about the differences between circumstance and divine intervention. For the first hour he quietly stayed back against the wall, watching the two of us. There is a bottle of red wine close to his side along with the new sack of foods I brought in the corner behind him. He just existed. Some makeshift metal rings buried in his facial hair ran through his nose and bottom lip, which I didn’t notice at first. Brown-blond hair falls to the side beneath the brim of his hat. He is dark, shady, and very selective with what he’s said to me so far. He speaks his mother tongue, along with French, English, Portuguese, German, and soon Italian. The two of them have plans to migrate to Italy by the end of the year. Danny offers me wine from their bottle and a cigarette. I deny both. He asks two young ladies passing by for a cigarette. They initially declined and continued past us, but then returned moments later with two cigarettes. One to share, and one to save.</p>

<p>“And you don’t smoke?” Ed asks again. 
“No,” I respond. 
“Good,” he says. “Don’t start.” 
“Unless you don’t like who you are,” Danny calmly chimes in.</p>

<p>Ed finishes his thought, “Waking up in the morning without cigarettes is worse than dying. Your body collapses on itself during the night. Like oysters clinging to your insides, they grind up against you and you can’t breathe until you smoke two or three and hack the shit up.” 
“A fucking bastard drug that changes who you are.” 
…
“You play chess?”</p>

<p>And so Ed and I begin our game. He carefully lifts a tiny plastic chessboard from his possessions and sets it between us. I notice that the black set is missing a knight that has been replaced by one of his teeth. It’s rounded and worn, with a silver filling in the cavity. This set is placed in front of him and the white set is initially placed closer to me. He picks a piece from each side, closes his fists, and mixes them. He then holds his outstretched arms out before me. I touch his right hand to reveal a black piece in his palm. He rotates the board and gives me the black pieces and the tooth.</p>

<p>When the game begins, I get a feel for what I am up against. Ed is a smart, forward-thinking strategist that knows how to prepare for the future. His finger twitches as he counts out the moves I will eventually make. I know the game is in his hands for the majority of the time, but I try not to let him know that. As the game progresses, there is a short period where the control shifts from his side to mine, but eventually moves back to his. I become less focused and lose my confidence in chess. I get distracted and pay more attention to the situation. This hour of quiet introspection hunched over the board is familiar and easy. I find comfort on the ground in Marseille watching the people pass by, towering above us. 
He makes a huge diagonal move from across the board and takes a key rook of mine. I disappointedly exhale. “It’s still the same game!” Danny adds, looking at me like a father or a coach. I feel cared for. The oceanfront wind moves through the buildings like a wind tunnel. Exposed and stripped of measure, I feel solidarity between strangers and have found value in this uncommon situation.</p>

<p>I look back down to the board and continue to make moves. A calculated “check” falls from Ed’s mouth. “It’s over, but we’re going to play until the bloody end.” And we do. We play until I lose. Grins turn up on our faces. I shake Ed’s hand and admit to defeat in a well - deserved victory.</p>

<p>Two young French girls pass by and ask if we are brothers. “To some extent, yea.”</p>

            </div>
                
            <div class="content_div"><p>I’m conflicted. I often don’t like myself as a person and today happens to be one of those mornings when I wish there was much more room between me and myself. 
The most beautiful morning emerges from beyond the horizon. The pastel gradient sky touches pale lavender, red, yellow, and green, before spreading across in the most abundant blue. Clouds mix with contrails and compose empty space. These orange strokes are complementary to the water and earth. The scene is a blurry picture that rushes past me. Although the day is still in the making and it may be too early to tell, it is good. Did nature decide this, or did I?</p>

<p>The iron tracks hug the coast. We pass small tucked-in villages with cubed buildings that soak in the sun. I imagine that landscapes such as these are the source of inspiration for realist oil-painters. Renoir, Bonheur, Courbet, and the likes come to mind. Shadows are blue, not black, and they allow for subtle cracks and textures in the shaded areas to remain visible. This blue fills in the sides not lucky enough to feel the rising sun.</p>

<p>I let the colors into my eyes and realize that beauty does not merely exist in immensely complex and arduous works. Beauty may be simple and often times it is. It can be an accident. When a community comes together, it rarely happens all at one time or with one final product in mind. Construction can be entirely serendipitous. These buildings were made one after another as a means to an end. There are lessons to be learned from the homes that cluster in the crests of the rolling terrain, or the chapel with a pointed steeple adorning the top of the highest point. The little villages quietly command attention as we pass. They are either too small or we are moving too fast. We pass so quickly that these thoughts are written from brief memories. The train comes up on more elaborate constructions.</p>

<p>Big businesses, industrial parks, and factories smog up the sky. You can’t see the pollution once the smoke assimilates into the rest of the blue, but I know it’s there. I know that the imposturous chemicals can find no escape except in camouflage. I know that the air above the polluting smokestacks is changing for the worse once the gray fades and separates. Rusty gray pylons and conveyor belts hang around like broken appendages. Limp and lifeless, they bend at the whim of their designers. Beauty has been sacrificed for productivity and efficiency. The factory is one body built to serve a single purpose. Where are the good looks in that? 
There is a parking lot, but it is empty. What’s going on inside the factory while no one is there? This industrialized view, unfortunately, stays around for much longer than the small villages. We move and it moves with us, dragging behind and begging for attention.</p>

<p>We escape it when my window turns black. Beneath cement and earth, we duck down and leave the factory behind.</p>

Montpellier is a small city that has both preserved its history and radically adopted new technology. The tramline peeks in and out of concrete plazas and the mirrored glass facades of 21st century buildings extenuate and reanimate the past life of stone buildings. For now, I celebrate alone. This is a toast dedicated to the days spent for myself. I try to ignore my throbbing hip and cool my scratchy throat by drinking from a lemon seltzer water bottle refilled with still water. I’ve claimed a bench overlooking the artificially green Lez River below. My rented bike is on the kickstand behind me and I unwrap an icy blue cough drop from its aluminum tray. Funnily enough, these are the moments I enjoy most.</p>

Back and forth, between the two ends and always in the middle. Here in this gradient plane, I believe I am alone. I can’t bring myself to commit to either side at any point soon. A bankrupt soul for a happy heart? Can’t the two coexist? Isn’t it possible for black and white to create balance, repetition, movement, scale, and beauty? My insides aren’t any different than others’. At least they shouldn’t be.</p>

<p>I open myself up, take a blade deep into my fat stomach and pull it across. It is a division that becomes gaping insight to the things that make me. I stare down past my chest and watch a gray curdled mush slowly spill out and into my lap.</p>

I’m tired of waiting to be happy with my decisions, my educational track, and my career. Just because I think that Marketing and Graphic Design go hand in hand does not mean that they actually do or will. I don’t foresee myself being happy at the start of my career because of the expectations employers have of recent graduates. This cross compatibility sounds great in my head, but I can’t see the path I will take out into the real world.</p>

<p>Conscientiousness does not equate to clarity. Just because I tell myself with conviction that success will come doesn’t mean that I am anywhere close to seeing that goal through. Even in the right place under the light of the right idea, the future professional I want to become can’t tell me what to do. For all I know, I could have bought a ticket way up at the top of the theatre and wouldn’t be able to see through the silhouettes in front of me.</p>

I am astounded as I peer over the edge into the black and my insides collapse. I realize that there is some capacity for my imagination to make up the dimensions of the hole, but imagination spawns from truth. This truth lies in the similarities between my days and those of the impoverished. The only difference between tourism and homelessness is the amount of money in your pocket</p>

<p>I arrive in a city, take to the streets, and am eager to experience the day for what it is worth. I am look forward to solving the problems that come my way. I step down from the train, the bus, the plane, the whatever, and the sun is always shining. I venture to the hostel and for a period of time I am lost. I have a map, but I am by no means found. I do not know where exactly I will sleep tonight, but I know that there is a place reserved for me. This feeling of certainty is the fine line between the two occupations of time. It is this sample of unsurety that allows me to know the complications that come through doing nothing.</p>

<p>How can I better understand life on the streets than to put myself there? I envisioned myself asleep on the ground. I seek clarity for these visions because ambiguity makes me uncomfortable. I seek the innocence of the dove and the wisdom of the wolf.</p>

The throngs of people and drinks create semi-reflective conversations, but they are shallow and quickly drain. I can hardly keep my thoughts.</p>

<p>I look over my shoulder to see the rain drizzling down from the gray evening sky. It’s not a heavy rain; it’s light and a bit refreshing. I stop moving in order to take in the scene and let the water drip from my lashes to obscure the commotion of the streets. The mediocre advertisements, neon signs, headlights, vibrant refractions of red double-decker buses, cellphones, and police flashers spread out before me as I squint my eyes. They create a collage that moves in real-time. 
My eyes let in more light when I relax my pupils. I allow the objects to fall further from focus in order to let their shapes grow larger and larger. Slowly, inspiration blooms.</p>

<p>I balance between the blurriness and my mind’s desire to understand the details. The colors are free of form and my mind can’t stand it. Suddenly, a final set of headlights turn the corner closest to me and painfully enter through my eyes. I tightly close them and rub my face.</p>

<p>Turning back, I tighten my backpack and catch up to the group.</p>

<p>I am changing, perhaps faster than I can take and faster than I can understand. Here, then there, I am made from pieces coming from all sides bound to a central point. It’s complicated and out of my control. What do I do with knowledge that can’t be defined? What is to be said about new and indescribable existence?</p>

I’ll follow up in March and see if that would be a good time for you to provide responses or if you’d like to wait a bit. Also, if you have a headshot and/or any pictures of the university and your study abroad experience, we would love to include those as well. Thank you very much for your help with this. I’ll be sure to let you know when the article is published.</p>

<p>Please tell me all about your study abroad trip. I want to know what you are studying/ what classes are you taking and how does this apply to your major? Why did you choose Kedge in Marseille, France? How long will you be there?”</p>

<p>Courses: Organizational Behavior, Principles of Marketing, Sustainable Development, Management Information Systems</p>

<p>KEDGE Business School is within the top circle for the Grand Ecole system in France. It is a well-respected college on an international level and has a local reputation of being reserved for the best in the city. Marseille itself is the second largest city in France. The Vieux Port was among the first in the world to link intercontinental trade and has been the business hub of the continent and much of the world for 26 centuries. Its location is the access point across the Mediterranean Sea to trade in North Africa and the Middle East. Both of these areas and their many cultures are represented here. While the strict French typecast is present, there is a much broader level of international diversity in the streets, businesses, and the KEDGE campus. It’s similar to GMU in a lot of ways and I do feel that the diversity in our school has prepared me for international life like this.</p>

<p>“Which study abroad programs did you look at and why did you choose the one you did?”</p>

<p>There weren’t many options for me. I’ve studied French for four years and am committed to putting French fluency on my resume. This commitment lead me to KEDGE. It’s a direct exchange program which makes the application and credit transfer very simple. I told myself that if I was going to learn a language, I was going to learn it from its source, and this city and the people have been very helpful in getting me to that point. I’ve developed familiarity with the language much more than I’ve been able to in the classroom.</p>

<p>“What are you looking forward to most during this experience? What do you anticipate being your key takeaway from this trip- personally and to apply to the business world?”</p>

<p>This trip has presented me with many great opportunities. The one I look forward to most is celebrating Easter at St. Peter’s Square with Pope Francis. In only two months, however, I’ve been able to do some incredible things. I’ve toured South France, skied the Alps, learned French from native speakers, rented my first apartment, thrived in global diversity, developed my career, and made connections that will last long after I touch back down at Dulles. A concise list is no longer possible because my time abroad has developed nearly every part of my personality. I set out with the goal to consolidate the traits of my role model. I’ve done that and more.</p>

<p>“Any advice for students considering studying abroad at Mason?”</p>

<p>Studying abroad is a commitment that anyone who is considering surely realizes. My advice before making any serious decision is to make sure that the product sits well with your head and your heart. If the three don’t make sense together, you’ll eventually reach a point where you question your decision. If you question, you’ll be led to doubt and doubt leads to regret. The last thing you want to do is regret being alone on a flight out of the country for half a year.</p>

<p>There has to be purpose for you to study abroad, whether it’s for credits toward your degree or for the language. Logically justify why you want to do it and what it will do for you. Secondly, make sure you’re emotionally invested in the challenge. Love the idea of what the time away will do to you, set goals to keep yourself on track, and be prepared to be uncomfortable nearly every day while you’re away. Know that things will go wrong and you will miss whatever you’ve left back home.</p>

<p>“What does it mean to you to be awarded the Gilman Scholarship? Can you tell me a bit about the application process for you?”</p>

<p>It means a great deal to have been given the Gilman Scholarship. I’ve taken a piece from the last paragraph of one of my application essays. I spoke honestly when I said:</p>

<p>“I will proudly carry the name of Mr.Gilman. Receiving his scholarship would alleviate the costs of the exchange, but more than that, it would reaffirm solidarity within myself… The ever-prevalent idea that we are the ultimate determinants of our own happiness is nothing without the participation of others…”</p>

<p>The Gilman International Scholarship sees what I am doing. They’ve read my intentions as I carefully poured my heart into their essay windows and they stand behind my endeavors. Their support is invaluable. No matter how much I want to be independent and for success to come by my own hand, we will be able to achieve more, faster, when we learn to be interdependent.</p>

<p>By looking to Gilman for help, I was required to be vulnerable and to put myself on the line. It cost me time and a lot of it. I spent at least an hour a day for the better part of the summer months writing the essays, hunting for the most concise way to speak about the depth of my past, and the goals I have for the future. 
“What has been your favorite experience while studying abroad thus far?”</p>

<p>I’ve recently returned from London with some students at KEDGE. The Commission des Opérations Boursières et Financiers (COBFI) is one of the school’s business organizations. It has just paired with the London School of Economics (LSE) and got our group a spot in a lecture with some professors from the University. Professor Alan Manning and Nicola Smith lead a discussion afterwards that gave me insight to the differences between the US minimum wage and the UK wage. It’s been interesting to see the differences between cultures in the most basic parts of society. These are the things I have never thought of any differently and, frankly, didn’t think any other way existed.</p>

<p>The day after the lecture at LSE we toured London, I had some time with a few friends I met in Barcelona, and the evening was spent in the Bloomberg London offices. I’m not a math person. I barely got out of Hylton’s accounting class and yet I really enjoyed my time with the company. While the majority of the evening was spent talking numbers and using the Bloomberg Terminal, I was able to break away from the group and sit down at the workspace with one of the company’s marketing project managers. She and I spoke about her daily schedule, opportunities within the company, and also about my potential involvement. In this meeting I got well-needed perspective and am tempted to write about how this experience is going to change my career concretely.</p>

<p>The truth is that I don’t know exactly what is to come for me and this semester has made me fully understand that. I work hard and get involved with those things I think are admirable, but truthfully I only have intuition to go off of. What I do know now is that I’m on the cusp of some big opportunities, the likes of which I didn’t think would come so soon. My goals grow very fast and I’m told, “go big or go home, right?” I’ve decided I don’t want to go home.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>Metallic buzz, cold reverb, still air, and nothingness. There’s blank space between my eyes and the shivering stones of this Gothic church. I sit and stare blankly, noticing the momentary speckles of falling dust. They glisten. I’m at peace until a strange man steps into the sanctuary. He’s dressed in all black but is not a priest. He looks tiny because the ceiling hangs and looms ominously above his dusty brown head. His soft-heeled shoes make more sound than they should in this quiet place. It’s early evening. The tranquil specks drift through the stained light that gleam in the fading sun. Heel, toe, heel, toe, with purpose and pattern, his steps break the air. My neck turns so my eyes can follow him. He reaches the center of the marble altar, clicks his ankles together, and bends at the waist in a way that makes me think that he cracked his spine in a few places. He straightens his back, puts his hands down to his side, and continues on his way. He steps diagonally up onto the altar and then to the lectern.</p>

<p>I’ve finally found the buzzing sound. It is the anxiety that sparsely fills the void from the high-backed pews to the ceiling. The man touches the little microphone once and it reacts to him three times. Sounds of his finger echoes down the aisle. The wiring whines as it is probed to stand taller and nearly touch the man’s lips. He steps away and leaves its space. He moves back, following his old footsteps exactly. I follow him back across the altar and watch as he leaves the room.</p>

<p>I look back to the lectern. The buzzing grows, cycling through the microphone and speakers, starting at a mumble and then turning into a pitched hum. It is a subtle call for help that sounds with more and more haste. It swells until it loses its innocent tickle. The mouth widens and the chords rub against one another. Some treacherous being has come from the dark crypts below. Its cold stone teeth and stained-glass eyes widen with ferocity. It rises through the floor and violently erupts with ash and dust. The screams from the damsel fill the room and multiply on their way back and forth between the walls. The bitter black particles flood the space and then collapse over the soundwaves.</p>

<p>Her echoes are abruptly suppressed and silence moves back in. The once prismatic windows are now shattered. The man in black comes back. She quietly begs for his help. Kneeling before him and wrapping her hand around the back of his leg, she gently touches his chin. He is not moved. Removing her arm from his body and circling around, he covers her mouth and pulls her back into the slow-moving, billowy ash.</p>

<p>The dust settles, there’s a low hum, and cold reverb moves back through the room.</p>

            </div>
                
            <div class="content_div"><p>In the top tier of the coliseum, I lay out under the sun. For the first time in a long time, I can feel the heat from the sun directly and without shivery, oceanic winds interrupting. My arm is bent to use my hand as a pillow between the wide stone slab and the back of my head. I twist my neck to look down into the sand pit below.</p>

<p>Sand covers the middle of the Roman arenas so that when it is churned, it will mask the smell of blood. The dignitaries, the cheerers, the politicians, and the other onlookers bet on the few fighters that play to kill in a game of glory, but can not stomach the consequences. They mix the sand to cover the blood. I think about dying; more specifically, martyrdom. The sand in the center soaks up the blood of both the hunted animals and criminals. This is a place that you enter knowing that you may not leave. Your life is gambled for either fame or demise.</p>

<p>I think to my future visit to Rome itself, and then the Vatican. Am I walking into a coliseum with a square center? I reflect on the publicized threat of terrorism and then on my own death. I see it happen. I watch myself die several times, in several ways. A lion enters through the gates and men prod it to step out into the light of the arena. I see the death of children and visualize myself fighting for the lives of the others around me. I am ultimately bloodied and captured beneath the feet of opposition. I see smoke and tears, grimacing faces, and white light turning red. I feel the pain of laceration, torture, and morbid dehumanization.</p>

<p>We say there is new life in Christ, but only through physical death. Only death motivates those who oppose the Church. Masses file into the ring and wait for the game to start. It begins with some shadowy beast pouncing out of the dark. The spectacle is dramatic and ostentatious, within the true sense of showmanship. There is an explosion of dust and my vision fails. We can see outlines but cannot clarify bodies because these nouveau- Romans brought tear gas. There is jeering and booing until the first blood is shed; then come the wails of death. Tooth and nail first pierces the skin of those who are chained by fear. They are bound to the pillars by which they stand. They die before the rest while others try to get away. Father puts up a fight. Mother covers her babies as her back is torn to shreds. Blood and spine separate and red splatters in our eyes. Children watch as their mothers are disassembled and color soles like water-based paints. These stains won’t be cleaned. The son’s tears don’t last forever because his brain isn’t receiving oxygen. Father failed. The beast moves and multiplies, pulling apart from itself. Family, single, couple, layperson, teacher, or priest; different yet all the same to the only eyes that matter in St. Peter’s Square.</p>

<p>Their name, ISIS, s with hate, and is praised across the border. All hail and celebrate how this authority was dethroned in style and irony. I see the red and then the black. I begin to realize the severity of my choice for the coming weeks. Courage is the scale of martyrdom. None of them entered into the coliseum knowing that they would leave. That’s not how the Word works.</p>

<p>The turmoil of our lives must be faced with faith and conviction. Without this understanding, we are invertebrates too passive to fight. I will fight for the life that I want. I ask myself, “Am I willing to leave those people back home?” “Am I ready to be vulnerable for the sake of my convictions?” Lord knows that I can’t say, and I surely can’t write it down. I do know that I head to the Valley and that this Easter may end my life.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>I will be there. With all that I have, with what I do not, with all of my gifts and talents, with my love and devotion, with my thoughts, and with my brothers and my mother in mind. I will go because it is my passion. Suddenly, these writings have more purpose. These words make sense and my body is filled with reason and value that is tangible beyond my understanding. I am more than gold in city streets or water in the desert. I am more than failing flesh and rotting bone. What I do has value. God, that hasn’t been easy to say for the last 20 years. I would never deny it but I could never believe it. It is still hard to accept love, but right now love means something real. This value has weight, matter, scale, and presence because You have shown it to me over these past months. This love swells my insides until I can no longer ignore it. My heart sways heavily and my back bends from the burden. There is new balance. It keeps my chest down and my lungs tight. I move to the altar and breathe to my capacity.</p>

<p>I must become better for the sake of my world. I tremble at the thought of surviving in second light. In death, there is new life. That is what You tell me and what You give me. You tell me that when I die, my life will be worth more than the business I do, the money I make, and the constructions I lead. If I change one heart, it will be worth it. I dwell on home and love. My friends and family: Mom, Matthew, Daniel, Ian, Hunter, Doe, Kez, Snek, Clem, and Kalna. I think of K, Marijka, Kalia, and Mace, Patty, Iz, and Emmie. I think of the ones I’ve let into my life. I am thankful for the ones given to me to share my time with. The times we’ve had together are worth any struggle. The time we have shared is valuable because the scale of eternity tilts with the weight of a beloved memory.</p>

<p>What kills me is that now is too perfect of a time to die. I love how You complete me even though I am now broken. I love the way You give my life purpose. These random pieces are connected through one vein. Your blood runs through every part of me when I am completely convicted. You’ve shown me what trust looks like in the past three months. You’ve shown me interdependence. You’ve shown me what the product of our union is through the work of my own hands. You’ve shown me that what I called “imperfection” can be made perfect. You’ve shown me loss and desolation. You have never failed to show me the view from the highest mountain. You’ve shown me the work of Your hands, and I try to give you the work of mine. I follow Your fingers and the center of Your palm. I follow Your footsteps as You lead me. I have not traveled alone for a single moment. I shiver in the warmth I never thought I deserved. I question my reality because it is created and planned by someone else. Life is beautiful beyond my current understanding. My choices and feelings that I call my own are not just mine. I don’t have the intelligence to verbalize these conclusions, leaving me in awe of the splendid world.</p>

He who believes in Him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.</p>

I don’t want to hold this in because it’s not easy to cope by myself. While Easter threatens my life, life itself is not mine to hold onto. She told me that through her actions. I am not in control and she changed me. She changes me into something shaky and uncomposed. I don’t want to talk about myself when I listen to her because I know my voice. I want to understand hers. I try harder to be better because of her.</p>

<p>I told her about my death, what I never want to tell anyone about. It’s difficult to trust people, and with her I hand over control so easily.</p>

I’ve seen more money move in a few days than ever before. I remember when I was a kid and thought a lot of money was $20. That quickly became $100, $100 become $1,000, and now it sits at $10,000. When I was 15 and first received paychecks, the cash coming my way made me feel like a king for a day. Here in Paris, I’m looking at price tags marked at $14,000 for an ugly bag or $15,000 for a watch. I will never forget witnessing the flippant decision between two four-digit and equally useless (and ugly) handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I could justify any of these purchases at any point in my life. These thousands of euros, dollars, and pounds (of flesh) could change the life of someone else. For $10,000, the price of two semesters at university, I could get a man off the streets and bring him to self-sufficiency. I could develop 3rd world communities and change the standards of living for hundreds of people with $15,000. My eyes and my head can’t comprehend the blind vision of the lucky few buying Givenchy, Bulgari, Fendi, Fendi, Louis, Louis, Prada trash.</p>

And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,</p>

<p>And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.”</p>

Despite what I want, ambition keeps me to my word. “It’s one night,” I tell myself. It’s one out of a thousand that the homeless face. My internal conflict switches sides quickly and I lean back and forth. The eight euros that I spent on my hostel for the night weigh heavily on my mind. It’s cold, it’s not safe, and someone could steal my backpack if I fall asleep. If my phone and wallet were taken from me, I would feel it in the pit of my stomach for months to come. The money and documentation that were so difficult to obtain would be a nightmare to replace. I realize that I am risking more than just my possessions.
My heart is torn between two individuals. Half belongs to the person that I want to be, while the other to the person that I am now. I give reason after reason to escape this self-deprecating inner conversation. Every time, however, my conscience comes full circle and keeps me involved. This vicious cycle resorts back to one idea consistently: “I am not intimidated by the devil.” I battle between the choice of bed or concrete. My hip flexor, my blisters, and my knee all twinge painfully. I lean on the short stone wall that overlooks the river and hang my head low between my shoulders.</p>

<p>While I do not know what will happen, I choose to face the streets tonight. It surely goes against the advice of all others back home and their response may be resoundingly negative when they find out. Tomorrow my decision will be justified. I will have perspective and experience, which I value beyond the threat to my safety. I didn’t think I would make it to Italy, yet here I am alive and well. Here begins life like it won’t last.</p>

<p>I step in for dinner at a humble cafe. The gelato there is old and served after being frozen. The sandwiches look decent but aren’t substantial. Since this small place doesn’t have enough seating for the few people inside, I offer the open table beside me to the couple who followed me in. They invite me to join them and so I do. We don’t talk at first because they speak Dutch. They talk back and forth as I listen quietly. She has some pink gelato and he drinks a beer. I chuckle at his jokes and after a game of charades, find out that they are leisurely travelling now that their kids are at university. They learn that I’m studying in Marseille. She calls for their check, and they get up to leave. We say our goodbyes and I stay to pass time.</p>

<p>After wearing off my welcome, I get up to pay the man behind the glass counter. Two men (one in the front of the cafe and the other now in the back) throw some Italian across the restaurant and inform me that the couple I sat with paid for my dinner. I welcome back the 8 euros spent on the empty hostel bed I reserved.</p>

<p>21:01 
I’m thinking about tomorrow morning. The only thing I have on my schedule is Mass at 8:30 at St. Peter’s Basilica. There are 12 hours until then. I’ve only just begun this long night and my eyes are aching already. I imagine the sunrise in my head, which pains my irises as if I’m actually looking at it. I get on a bus, mostly to rest. I woke up this morning at 8:00 and rushed out of the door to the airport. That was 12 hours ago. I realize that I am in the dead center, exactly where I hate to be. I cringe at the thought as it begins to lose balance. The driver mechanically steps on the gas long before I’ve made my way to the back. I catch myself and grab the dirty handrail hanging down from the roof of the bus. I sit down, noticing my reflection and the shallow bags beneath my eyes. I look at my palms. Using the public transportation here is giving me warts on my hands. It’s been 10 years since my fingers had warts on them and three are back since I’ve been in Europe.</p>

<p>I underestimated how much happened in public at night. As if it doesn’t exist and as if nothing happens just because I’ve never spent a night alone in the dark. I realize how far-stretched, long, and sleepless tonight will be. I’m sitting on edge, under fluorescent lights, as the night only just begins. All I can think to do is ride the bus for as long as I can.</p>

<p>The bus gets crowded. I stand for a while listening to conversations in languages I don’t speak. I am desperately far from being able to experience life through their eyes as I am outside of comprehension. Eavesdropping is a luxury I’ve long been stripped of. Although I’m around others, I can’t relate to anything that’s being said: the drama, the plans, and the nicely dressed people heading to a table set for two. I’m not a part of their world. I’m an American — a sad, barely bilingual American who is pretty far out of water, trying to take in air that’s not made for him. The bus breathes freely, however. I can feel the city’s life as the crowds fluctuate in and out. It all looks so different now, like they have privilege which magnifies my lack thereof. I feel lessened in the presence of others, as if I could stick out more than I already do.</p>

<p>These damned curvy yellow plastic bus seats along with the cold hard interior of the bus become more and more uncomfortable over time. The form-fitting spine of the chair supports the human body at first, but after a while feels painfully unnatural. This environment was made with the worst intentions. It’s as if it was made to be as uncomfortable as possible so people like me wouldn’t want to stay. Nonetheless, I stay as long as I can because it’s a safe haven. I ride the bus until the end of its line and am kicked off in a foreign language. It’s unexpectedly over.</p>

<p>I don’t have the words to explain desertion. I don’t know how to punctuate the gross abandonment I felt in the pit of my stomach when the engine of the bus cut. As if the fuel for the bus was the same that kept me running, I feel the engine die in the center of my chest. I descend into the cosmic black parking lot. There are two cars at the edge of the light and no other people around once the bus driver leaves. The stars above don’t mean anything and the lights of the apartment buildings shut me out. Scattered puddles mirror the speckled lights above them and ambiguate the line between the tar lot and the blacker night sky. It’s just past midnight and the mystery of everything, all at once, is multiplied by the lack of light and direction. I feel the wind and cold easily move through my jean jacket and t–shirt. The written words on signs and maps don’t make sense and I don’t know where to begin in piecing them together. My body, my head, and my heart have lost any sense of navigation here at some suburban outpost.</p>

<p>I tell myself my name is no longer my own and that I am someone new in order to cope. I’ll do anything to disconnect myself from who I am as a protective measure (whether this is protection from myself or from someone else, I don’t know). I know, however, that I don’t want this experience attached to my name anymore because it’s turning out to be much more intimidating that I originally imagined. I don’t want to make a decision or have to pick between right or left when both equally lead to shit. I don’t want to choose, lose, and then regret not taking the other, as if it could have been better. I am no one trying to outwit reflections of myself in puddles. I try to make it to sunrise because it’s the only thing I have to look forward to. Because suddenly my home is in church and I have no other seat reserved for me. That is the only thing I have to look forward to-take me off the streets and into those walls.</p>

<p>–:– 
I walk away from homes because I fear the moment a face turns the corner in front of me. I replay a moment like this several times to desensitize myself from the fear that would course through my body. I tell myself that when it happens I need to keep my mouth closed and my eyes focused, and carefully calculate how my limbs will react. I decide between fight or flight in preparation. Apartments spread out into windy neighborhoods and my mind meticulously keeps track of everything that I see. Graffiti and grass spew through cracks in the concrete. I’m led by the road into Roman suburbia, with my hands shoved into my pockets to keep them from the cold. I clench them tightly into fists and look up at a wide street sign. Its white background bends iridescent reflections of scattered lights.</p>

<p>My eyes lie. They speak of focus and purpose, both of which I am without. In a hyperactive state, my senses do all they can to protect me from threats. I can see behind myself when I hear engine noises and can feel lights press against my neck. I piece these hints together in my head and expect them as they approach. The lights of this on-coming car inspect me, along with the driver behind them. I clench my jaw tightly and sharpen my eyes. I fib my way through with my body language and the car moves past me, sending a shiver down my spine that causes me to stand straighter than before. I walk slower now, although I try to keep my pace up to maintain body heat. The buildings space out further and further until I see the end of the street lights quickly approaching. I stare once more into starry sky and empty earth. I continue forward, leaving the world in which I once dwelt. 
I am no longer affixed by the time or standards that measure days. I am now a part of a mindset without metrics, because I am only concerned for myself and for my protection. People have become opponents. I move out of time and into the spaciousness of experiences.</p>

<p>A black car approaches me slowly, much slower than the others before. It barely rolls at my walking speed. Suddenly it is beside me. The driver even made the effort to blacken the rims and darken the windows. The light of pale faces is barely visible through the window. I look and they look too. I stare into the window. With my eyes strong and my jaw tight, I communicate one message to the man as he looks back: “I am not scared of you.” I speak the truth. He passes me, pulls a U–turn back the other way, and accelerates away from me. I don’t know where he’s decided to go or if I’ll see his return. I don’t want to find out. I pull the straps on my backpack and quickly cross the street over to the sidewalk. I cross through several alleys and resolve to find a spot to lie low for a while. Here, where nature begins to mix with residence, I come across an alcove made of hedges and neatly-kept trees between the street and someone’s home. I cross through into the backyard and, after the branches return to their stillness and the last of the leaves hit the ground, it is finally quiet again. My breathing slows down. 
The windows of the house are dim. I am thankful to have come across this backyard just as the houses began to get more sparse down. God, I am glad there are no dogs here because I hear them echoing across the night above me. There’s a parked car on the stone driveway that winds up a curving hill. It goes around the side of the house and away from the street that I came from. It’s perfect, but in a perfect world I wouldn’t be doing this. A small, single-wide gate crosses just in front of me with a sign hanging from it. I can’t read what it says, however. I step closer to the sign, brushing past overgrown hedgerows. There’s an icon of a video surveillance system that gets a quick reaction out of me as soon as I figure it out. I back up recklessly, making a senseless ruckus. I ask myself where it is that I plan to go. I’m not leaving. If they are home, they’re asleep; if they aren’t home, they will watch the video in the morning and I’ll be gone. Nothing’s happened so far, no alarms have gone off, and I’m not going to let a sign keep me from the best spot I’ve found all night, yet another makeshift safe haven. I’ve found my way to my room.</p>

<p>It’s a narrow space, a kind of hall between street and yard. The worn and used path is faded to dirt. I get down on one knee, one palm on the ground and the other pressing on my knee. I pause to think about what I’m doing.</p>

<p>I continue down to the ground. I am still wearing my backpack as I move from one knee, to sitting, to laying on my side. At first, the relief to my body is pleasant. My head rests on the back of my hands and my nose is parallel with the ground. I can see my breath mix with the dirt that it moves. The smell of dirt reminds me of when my brothers and I were younger and of how we spent long sunny days building forts in the woods. We were a team of four along with some friends, setting out with a mission to build something. We would divide tasks, collect materials, and build based on talent. We knew our positions— although the youngest brother never seemed happy with his. Someone had to do those jobs and he got over it eventually. Maybe not that day, but after sleeping it over in the night, his anger was forgotten. Time passes in remembering.</p>

<p>The tip of my nose is getting cold. I breathe out of my mouth, into my palms cupped over my face. My left side chills against the ground. Comfortable becomes cold and colder. Minutes seem stuck in time. I shiver with the seconds. My arms are crossed and my jean jacket is buttoned up tight against my gut. The top button at the collar is open so that I can tuck my nose inside and trap heat. My muscles tighten, my legs are crookedly bent, and my feet writhe in pain.</p>

<p>Time isn’t passing fast enough, so I close my eyes and listen. I see the cars drive by in my head once more. I feel their headlights through my skin. They speed past me as I lay on the ground in the dirt in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>A twig cracks and frightens my eyes open. I didn’t have a choice whether or not to keep them closed. I lay still while my eyes dart quickly, looking for reason. They find nothing, and slowly and suspiciously close again. Just as my eyelashes meet in the middle, a painful probing light catches them and pulls them back. Every detail, every color, every overexposed leaf, shines in brightness. They are unnatural, unreal, and all too real at the same time. Every fold in my clothes is deepened in shadow and colored in full. I look toward the light as a car pulls into the driveway straight towards me. It’s 10 meters away and moving in my direction. I throw my head back and hide my face, trying to look like anything but a person sleeping in a corner of their yard. I tuck my feet into brush and get as still as I can. The car comes closer and the engine gets louder. The face I pictured the car having towers over me. I lie like a fool, but it sees straight through me. The shape of the car grows in ferocity and settles just past my gate to the house. The engine sputters. The two in the car step down onto the gravel and speak a language I wish I knew. They walk slowly as they make way from the car to the house. Clearer and clearer, as if they are getting closer, I can hear the thick stones being kicked around one by one. There are no voices, but the sound of feet moving. And then nothing. I think I am alone again.</p>

<p>Time passes. I am emotionally exhausted. What seemed like a long time has only been a couple of hours. The closest thing I’ll get to sleep tonight is a sort of mix between consciousness and daze, through which I blankly lay. My mind can’t choose between one or the other, so I remain in sheer pain. My whole body shakes uncontrollably. No bigger blanket, no extra jacket, nothing else but to deal with it. The pain grows incrementally over time, until I give up. I angrily get to my feet and leave the area without looking back. With more aggression than necessary, I hit the dirt and leaves from my clothes as I walk away. I don’t know where I’m going.</p>

<p>–:– 
I continue on, walking past the last house. I turn onto the highway leading out of the city. Morning dew condenses as I walk through the tall uncut grasses in the middle of the median. While my feet are getting soaked, I find some happiness in witnessing the formation of morning dew. I shiver and my teeth chatter. A car approaches me from behind and sounds its horn until it passes me. No doubt, the driver was trying to warn me of the dangers of walking on the highway. I see a sign for a campground and decide to make my way there. I follow the arrows. I cross the empty three–lane street and climb out of the highway, through sobbing grasses and up a steep dirt footpath. I head towards the front entrance of the camping complex and find the community washhouse. Its warm light spills out of the open doors. I pick up my pace, looking out for security, or for any sign of life. I’m not sure if this is a reasonable time to be out. I don’t belong here. I’m not paying for campsite privileges, but I’ve forgotten that they don’t know that.</p>

<p>I quietly enter the men’s side of the washhouse and scan the building for movement. I detect none, but my footsteps echo. I want so badly to sit beneath hot water for the rest of the night but I can’t. Finding a towel, making noises, and risking blatant detachment from my belongings would make the rest of the night far more difficult than necessary. I resort to warming my body with hot water on my face and hands, then leave after using the bathroom. I hope to find some place to stay nearby to claim for the remaining hours, but I don’t see any in sight. I explore the grounds and find individual apartment buildings. I see tents, some RVs, and plenty of small European cars clustered in a distant parking lot. It’s dark and I’m not in the state of mind to build a proper mental map of this place. I am powered by intuition, looking for any place that might serve as protection. I think I’ve found what I’m looking for when I open the door of the laundry room. None of the machines are running, but it’s warm and somehow noisy. I follow the walls searching for a place to lodge myself for a few hours, but find none. I circle the room twice and notice that there’s a large frosted window and door in the room leading to an office. It’s the ground’s security office. A still blue light from a computer is suddenly blocked by a blurry body moving in the direction of the door. I leave as quickly and quietly as I can.</p>

<p>I leave the room and go back outside. I follow the wall and hide in the shadow of the building. I watch a man leave through the same door I did, but continue straight onto the gravel. He has a flashlight in his hands but isn’t using it for some reason. I watch him turn left into a single-person apartment. I move in the opposite direction. I stumble upon a sidewalk sandwich board leaning up against one of the buildings. It’s got some drawings of pasta bowls on it. It leans on the side of the building under an awning and out of view. It’s a cluttered corner that will serve as my bed for the rest of the night. I pick up the board and unfold it so it stands on its own. I move behind it and look at the grounds. I see the laundry room and the campground office. As soon as they open up, I’m checking in, getting a shower, and sleeping. I can’t do this much longer.</p>

<p>–:– 
With my knees to my chest and my right shoulder against the wall of the restaurant, I close my eyes and after some time, feel my muscles lose all intention. My fingers slip and then unlock. Finally my left arm hits the sign and lands on the ground with a painfully loud thud. I tighten up again, bringing my legs back in to make sure I am as unnoticeable as possible from someone else’s perspective. The security guard’s lit flashlight passes over my corner twice. I’m not far at all from the laundromat, and therefore from his office. He must pass me in order to get to the door we shared quite some time ago. I pass through the night in a mix of psychosis and anxiety about my secrecy. I realize that if I stay here much longer than first light, I could easily be found out. I remain still, with eyes closed, not asleep, conscious and making decisions about my body position and about the dreams in my head. In and out, I can’t enjoy sleep.</p>

<p>Time slowly passes.</p>

<p>–:– 
I first hear birds chirping in my head. They pan from my left ear, to both ears, then to the right ear, but not wholly to the right because my head is resting on the brick wall. The insides of my eyelids are a shaded pale purple. I open them and see the first light of morning. The birds are real and the sky has color again. I leave the grounds and find a bus stop because the offices don’t open until 10:00. It’s 5:00. I’m not getting anymore sleep tonight and I’ve got Mass to get to at St. Peter’s. Exhausted, I make several awfully bad choices with regards to bus numbers and end up far away from the Vatican.</p>

<p>I get off the bus about a mile up the river from my destination. With sunlight beaming down on me, I walk up toward the magnificent dome. Dark has truly made way for the most beautiful morning. My joints are aching and my muscles are relaxing, but my mind is moving much quicker than before. I notice a difference in the way I view both the streets and other people. I am different after last night. I know what it’s like to walk more than a mile in someone else’s shoes.</p>

<p>I continue, looking up every now and then to acknowledge the morning jogger and to refocus on the growing Vatican dome.</p>

I am no longer affixed by the time or standards that measure days. I am now a part of a mindset without metrics, because I am only concerned for myself and for my protection. People have become opponents. I move out of time and into the spaciousness of experiences.</p>

<p><br />
A black car approaches me slowly, much slower than the others before. It barely rolls at my walking speed. Suddenly it is beside me. The driver even made the effort to blacken the rims and darken the windows. The light of pale faces is barely visible through the window. I look and they look too. I stare into the window. With my eyes strong and my jaw tight, I communicate one message to the man as he looks back: “I am not scared of you.” I speak the truth. He passes me, pulls a U–turn back the other way, and accelerates away from me. I don’t know where he’s decided to go or if I’ll see his return. I don’t want to find out. I pull the straps on my backpack and quickly cross the street over to the sidewalk. I cross through several alleys and resolve to find a spot to lie low for a while. Here, where nature begins to mix with residence, I come across an alcove made of hedges and neatly-kept trees between the street and someone’s home. I cross through into the backyard and, after the branches return to their stillness and the last of the leaves hit the ground, it is finally quiet again. My breathing slows down.</p>

<p><br />
The windows of the house are dim. I am thankful to have come across this backyard just as the houses began to get more sparse down. God, I am glad there are no dogs here because I hear them echoing across the night above me. There’s a parked car on the stone driveway that winds up a curving hill. It goes around the side of the house and away from the street that I came from. It’s perfect, but in a perfect world I wouldn’t be doing this. A small, single-wide gate crosses just in front of me with a sign hanging from it. I can’t read what it says, however. I step closer to the sign, brushing past overgrown hedgerows. There’s an icon of a video surveillance system that gets a quick reaction out of me as soon as I figure it out. I back up recklessly, making a senseless ruckus. I ask myself where it is that I plan to go. I’m not leaving. If they are home, they’re asleep; if they aren’t home, they will watch the video in the morning and I’ll be gone. Nothing’s happened so far, no alarms have gone off, and I’m not going to let a sign keep me from the best spot I’ve found all night, yet another makeshift safe haven. I’ve found my way to my room.</p>

<p><br />
It’s a narrow space, a kind of hall between street and yard. The worn and used path is faded to dirt. I get down on one knee, one palm on the ground and the other pressing on my knee. I pause to think about what I’m doing.</p>

<p><br />
I continue down to the ground. I am still wearing my backpack as I move from one knee, to sitting, to laying on my side. At first, the relief to my body is pleasant. My head rests on the back of my hands and my nose is parallel with the ground. I can see my breath mix with the dirt that it moves. The smell of dirt reminds me of when my brothers and I were younger and of how we spent long sunny days building forts in the woods. We were a team of four along with some friends, setting out with a mission to build something. We would divide tasks, collect materials, and build based on talent. We knew our positions— although the youngest brother never seemed happy with his. Someone had to do those jobs and he got over it eventually. Maybe not that day, but after sleeping it over in the night, his anger was forgotten. Time passes in remembering.</p>

<p><br />
The tip of my nose is getting cold. I breathe out of my mouth, into my palms cupped over my face. My left side chills against the ground. Comfortable becomes cold and colder. Minutes seem stuck in time. I shiver with the seconds. My arms are crossed and my jean jacket is buttoned up tight against my gut. The top button at the collar is open so that I can tuck my nose inside and trap heat. My muscles tighten, my legs are crookedly bent, and my feet writhe in pain.</p>

<p><br />
Time isn’t passing fast enough, so I close my eyes and listen. I see the cars drive by in my head once more. I feel their headlights through my skin. They speed past me as I lay on the ground in the dirt in the middle of the night.</p>

<p><br />
A twig cracks and frightens my eyes open. I didn’t have a choice whether or not to keep them closed. I lay still while my eyes dart quickly, looking for reason. They find nothing, and slowly and suspiciously close again. Just as my eyelashes meet in the middle, a painful probing light catches them and pulls them back. Every detail, every color, every overexposed leaf, shines in brightness. They are unnatural, unreal, and all too real at the same time. Every fold in my clothes is deepened in shadow and colored in full. I look toward the light as a car pulls into the driveway straight towards me. It’s 10 meters away and moving in my direction. I throw my head back and hide my face, trying to look like anything but a person sleeping in a corner of their yard. I tuck my feet into brush and get as still as I can. The car comes closer and the engine gets louder. The face I pictured the car having towers over me. I lie like a fool, but it sees straight through me. The shape of the car grows in ferocity and settles just past my gate to the house. The engine sputters. The two in the car step down onto the gravel and speak a language I wish I knew. They walk slowly as they make way from the car to the house. Clearer and clearer, as if they are getting closer, I can hear the thick stones being kicked around one by one. There are no voices, but the sound of feet moving. And then nothing. I think I am alone again.</p>

<p><br />
Time passes. I am emotionally exhausted. What seemed like a long time has only been a couple of hours. The closest thing I’ll get to sleep tonight is a sort of mix between consciousness and daze, through which I blankly lay. My mind can’t choose between one or the other, so I remain in sheer pain. My whole body shakes uncontrollably. No bigger blanket, no extra jacket, nothing else but to deal with it. The pain grows incrementally over time, until I give up. I angrily get to my feet and leave the area without looking back. With more aggression than necessary, I hit the dirt and leaves from my clothes as I walk away. I don’t know where I’m going.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I continue on, walking past the last house. I turn onto the highway leading out of the city. Morning dew condenses as I walk through the tall uncut grasses in the middle of the median. While my feet are getting soaked, I find some happiness in witnessing the formation of morning dew. I shiver and my teeth chatter. A car approaches me from behind and sounds its horn until it passes me. No doubt, the driver was trying to warn me of the dangers of walking on the highway. I see a sign for a campground and decide to make my way there. I follow the arrows. I cross the empty three–lane street and climb out of the highway, through sobbing grasses and up a steep dirt footpath. I head towards the front entrance of the camping complex and find the community washhouse. Its warm light spills out of the open doors. I pick up my pace, looking out for security, or for any sign of life. I’m not sure if this is a reasonable time to be out. I don’t belong here. I’m not paying for campsite privileges, but I’ve forgotten that they don’t know that.</p>

<p><br />
I quietly enter the men’s side of the washhouse and scan the building for movement. I detect none, but my footsteps echo. I want so badly to sit beneath hot water for the rest of the night but I can’t. Finding a towel, making noises, and risking blatant detachment from my belongings would make the rest of the night far more difficult than necessary. I resort to warming my body with hot water on my face and hands, then leave after using the bathroom. I hope to find some place to stay nearby to claim for the remaining hours, but I don’t see any in sight. I explore the grounds and find individual apartment buildings. I see tents, some RVs, and plenty of small European cars clustered in a distant parking lot. It’s dark and I’m not in the state of mind to build a proper mental map of this place. I am powered by intuition, looking for any place that might serve as protection. I think I’ve found what I’m looking for when I open the door of the laundry room. None of the machines are running, but it’s warm and somehow noisy. I follow the walls searching for a place to lodge myself for a few hours, but find none. I circle the room twice and notice that there’s a large frosted window and door in the room leading to an office. It’s the ground’s security office. A still blue light from a computer is suddenly blocked by a blurry body moving in the direction of the door. I leave as quickly and quietly as I can.<br />
I leave the room and go back outside. I follow the wall and hide in the shadow of the building. I watch a man leave through the same door I did, but continue straight onto the gravel. He has a flashlight in his hands but isn’t using it for some reason. I watch him turn left into a single-person apartment. I move in the opposite direction. I stumble upon a sidewalk sandwich board leaning up against one of the buildings. It’s got some drawings of pasta bowls on it. It leans on the side of the building under an awning and out of view. It’s a cluttered corner that will serve as my bed for the rest of the night. I pick up the board and unfold it so it stands on its own. I move behind it and look at the grounds. I see the laundry room and the campground office. As soon as they open up, I’m checking in, getting a shower, and sleeping. I can’t do this much longer.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
With my knees to my chest and my right shoulder against the wall of the restaurant, I close my eyes and after some time, feel my muscles lose all intention. My fingers slip and then unlock. Finally my left arm hits the sign and lands on the ground with a painfully loud thud. I tighten up again, bringing my legs back in to make sure I am as unnoticeable as possible from someone else’s perspective. The security guard’s lit flashlight passes over my corner twice. I’m not far at all from the laundromat, and therefore from his office. He must pass me in order to get to the door we shared quite some time ago. I pass through the night in a mix of psychosis and anxiety about my secrecy. I realize that if I stay here much longer than first light, I could easily be found out. I remain still, with eyes closed, not asleep, conscious and making decisions about my body position and about the dreams in my head. In and out, I can’t enjoy sleep.</p>

<p>Time slowly passes.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I first hear birds chirping in my head. They pan from my left ear, to both ears, then to the right ear, but not wholly to the right because my head is resting on the brick wall. The insides of my eyelids are a shaded pale purple. I open them and see the first light of morning. The birds are real and the sky has color again. I leave the grounds and find a bus stop because the offices don’t open until 10:00. It’s 5:00. I’m not getting anymore sleep tonight and I’ve got Mass to get to at St. Peter’s. Exhausted, I make several awfully bad choices with regards to bus numbers and end up far away from the Vatican.</p>

<p><br />
I get off the bus about a mile up the river from my destination. With sunlight beaming down on me, I walk up toward the magnificent dome. Dark has truly made way for the most beautiful morning. My joints are aching and my muscles are relaxing, but my mind is moving much quicker than before. I notice a difference in the way I view both the streets and other people. I am different after last night. I know what it’s like to walk more than a mile in someone else’s shoes.</p>

<p><br />
I continue, looking up every now and then to acknowledge the morning jogger and to refocus on the growing Vatican dome.</p>

            </div>
                
            <div class="content_div"><p>Five in the morning came with biting vengeance. It came quickly, with cloudy wet weather and cold winds. I shove my feet into my shoes and begin making my way to St. Peter’s Square. There’s already a group of seven at the bus stop, causing me to question if I woke up too late. The bus takes a long time to show up. When it finally arrives, the group comes down from their tiptoes, waiting for the bus to round the corner. We board the bus heading towards the Vatican in silence and excitement. There’s a group of five nuns next to me who are calmly and maturely smiling at one another. It’s early in the morning and I’m not sure what my body language is saying, but I’m probably not looking nearly as cool as these sisters are. It’s like Christmas morning for Catholics. We get off the bus and I immediately lengthen my stride to pass the group. Forget about the nuns; they’re eating my dust. I’m just trying to catch a good glimpse of the Pope.</p>

<p>The line, or rather the hoard, is bigger than I expected: 700 at least already. Suited men in cars honk their horns at the people blocking the streets leading to the gates of St. Peter’s Square. After I navigate through traffic and the surrounding people, I make the move I suspect others want to make. I’m not waiting at the back of the line. I pass the crowd and begin looking for anything or anyone. I am crooking my neck and picking out faces in the crowd. I’m posturing my body as if I’m looking for someone. Funnily enough, I found exactly who I was looking for. As if it makes any logical sense for me to find anyone from my old world, I find Drew, a perfectly familiar face that stands out. He’s from my university in Virginia. Drew stands on the edge of the crowd, dressed like an angel.</p>

<p>I greet Drew in loud American fashion and with overt excitement, possibly to validate my rudeness to the people I cut in front of to get here. He introduces me to his girlfriend and traveling partner. We also meet two other students from the U.S. studying in Rome thanks to our loud greeting. People are now beginning to pour into the line. It doubles, triples, and soon I can’t see its end. The line goes down the street across one of the city’s piazzas, which are also predictably packed with people spilling into the streets.</p>

<p>At 6:00, the floodgates open. The dreaded rain starts pouring while the metal detectors are activated. I don’t know how to explain how happy I was to be pushed around in this crowd of Catholics. They’ve got some fight in them. I knew it wasn’t going to be a stroll down the private school halls, but this energy was tremendous. There was a sudden two-meter rush until the crowd met at a bottleneck. Then there was even more pressure once those in the back heard that the line was moving. Glad you’re awake now, people. You’re celebrating Easter with the Pope today.</p>

<p>I am proud of the Church. I always have been. However, I feel differently today because I see the unholy and sloppy side of Catholics on full display as we all try to get inside the Square. People aren’t perfect, and I hate being in groups of friends who pretend like they are. Here, on Easter morning, there’s no hiding these beautifully rude and impatient pilgrims trying to make the most of the day.
We finally move through the detectors. Before I manage to get my belt back on, we somehow find seats only seven rows away from the altar. What did I do to deserve this? Never in my life did I imagine You would keep me so close. Never did I think I had the relevance to keep Your company like this. I am here in a space built for 80,000 people. There are only seven in front of me. Looking over their heads, I see only stone separating You and I. In front of me are the choir, the priests, and the nuns, who I guess had reserved seating and therefore had no need to rush off the bus. I’m closer than I ever dared to imagine. The Basilica faces me and I face it. The twelve Disciples and Jesus are looming above me, each sculpted out of stone and staring over the crowd below. I’ve never seen anything so ominously beautiful. Architecture is powerful. I’m standing at the base of these massive statues and sculpted white stones which all build up a facade that reaches far over my head. I shrink in comparison. I know that this one massive Church, surrounded by dark clouds and heavy rain, has stood firm through centuries. This Square, reverberating with the sounds of organs and song, will continue to go down in history. I am in awe knowing that I am backed by a beauty as great as this. I have no more words. 
As the rain falls, the temperature drops with it. We sit soaked to bone while minutes creep by in utter awfulness. Some people leave but most don’t. Some don’t understand why they are there, and some don’t feel as if they belong, yet the misery of this morning transcends worldly understanding. An hour ticked by, leaving us to endure the next. I dwell in the cold as I did during the measureless hours of my first night here in Rome. I am thankful for those hardships now and am more grateful for what I don’t understand. I’m also learning to be thankful for what I can’t control. I’m thankful that there was no rain during that night in the streets and for finding Drew when he could have been anywhere else in the world. I am thankful for the chance meetings throughout my time in Rome and for the many people I’ve met far from home. No matter whether it is framed as introversion or extroversion, we’re more dependent than I like to think.</p>

<p>An hour ticks by and we face the next.</p>

<p>I’m conflicted. I’m waiting on too many emails, depending on too many people, and yet these five days have been the most productive of my entire trip. I don’t have the ability to control the other side, such as the hiring manager or the admissions counselor. Nevertheless, I move myself according to modern American standards. 
I will set myself up for either side of ‘success.’ Blacked out or white light, I’ll be there to make the most of it.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>For the past 15 days, I haven’t written much. In fact, I am writing now because of something like shame. I don’t even want to have these moments in this book because I’ve been unwilling to admit my distraction. I’ve been spending too much money. My priorities have been a mixture of high productivity and vibrantly low choices. My sobriety is down the drain and not in a funny way. I’m sad. I’ve been laughing, crying, and bonding with friends. Although we’ve built strong relationships, I am skeptical about many things right now. I’m working to set up a great job when I get back to the U.S., I’m trying to take advantage of the summer I have between semesters, and I want to enjoy the time I have now, but I question how long these oddly-concocted friendships will last when they are mixed with alcohol and salt water.</p>

<p>I love the initiative, conviction, and ambition of the friends I’ve made on this journey. We got ourselves to France from all corners of the earth. Finally I’m not the sole decision maker in the group. We’ve been hiking, laughing, and chasing the sun as it sets past the Mediterranean water. We venture into the unknown and come out with something intangible: memories.</p>

<p>I’ve enjoyed my time in these moments, yet I look back and question their validity. 
I wake from a strange bed. Head spinning, I push myself to my feet and look down at the pool of vomit I am laying in. I wipe my arm across my face and pull some small chunks from my beard. My stomach sinks lower because I felt ill even before I opened my eyes. I am embarrassed, ashamed, and angry. Yet when they walk in and find me, they care for me. I doubt myself and feel like I will never live down this memory. I don’t want this and it is not who I am. My friends know this, yet I still hate it.</p>

<p>These now-brief moments of clear-headedness ask me to be critical. What I’ve done these past nights is out of character for me. What does this mean? I don’t think about who I am, but who can I become. What does this blurry vision make me and where will it lead me? I see that volatility in progress also includes negativity. 
Perhaps this is an indicator for caution as I move forward. I question whether this is what I’ve always wanted to see. Is this what it feels like to be “normal?” The parties I never went to and the stories I never told — are they the reality that exists on the backside of those flowery stories? I’ve visited the secret garden and its doesn’t smell as good as I’ve heard.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>“Once upon a time in Spain there lived a bull and his name was Ferdinand. All of the other little bulls in the pasture loved to run around and butt their heads together, but not Ferdinand. Ferdinand preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. He had a favorite spot in the shade under a cork tree in the pasture. He would sit there all day long and sit just quietly and smell the flowers. 
His mother, who was a cow, asked him if he wanted to play and butt heads like the other little bulls but Ferdinand said no, he preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. His mother, who was very understanding, decided to just let him be happy there under the cork tree.</p>

<p>After a while Ferdinand grew into a big, strong bull. All of the other bulls in the field still ran around and butted their horns together. What they wanted more than anything in the world was to be chosen from the big bull fights in Madrid. But not Ferdinand, he preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers.</p>

<p>One day, a group of men from Madrid came to the pasture to choose a bull for the bull fight. All of the bulls were so excited and proudly showed off how tough they were by butting their heads together and acting very fierce. Ferdinand knew he would not be chosen so he left to go sit under his cork tree in the shade. 
Ferdinand was not very careful when he found a spot to sit down because without looking; he sat straight down on a bee! Now if you were a bee and a big bull like Ferdinand sat on you, what would you do? You would sting him right? Well that is exactly what this bee did. Ferdinand jumped up and ran around bucking, and jumping, and acting like he was crazy. The men in the funny hats were so excited; they knew they had found the toughest meanest bull in all of Spain.</p>

<p>So they took Ferdinand away to Madrid in a cart.</p>

<p>On the day of the big bull fight, the people in Madrid were so excited to see the toughest bull in all of Spain. Everyone waved around handkerchiefs and shouted loudly. The women all wore flowers in their hair. They even had a parade.
The parade led into the bull ring. First came the banderilleros who would stick the bull to make him mad. Then came the picadores who rode big horses and stuck the bull with a long spear to make him even madder. Then came the matador, the toughest of them all. The matador stuck the bull last of all. He was so excited to fight the toughest bull in all of Spain.</p>

<p>Last of all came the bull. And you know who that was don’t you? They took Ferdinand out into the center of the ring. As he rode in the cart, he smelled all of the beautiful flowers worn by the ladies in the crowd. He was amazed at all of the people there to watch him. When they let him out of the cart, the banderilleros, picadores, and matador were all very afraid.</p>

<p>Ferdinand slowly walked out of the cart and into the bull ring, sat down quietly and just smelled.</p>

<p>No one could get Ferdinand to fight. The banderilleros tried, the picadores tried, the matador tried but no one could get Ferdinand to fight. The matador was so upset that he started crying. He would not be able to show the people how brave and strong he was.</p>

<p>So they had to take Ferdinand home, back to the pasture. And for all I know, he is still there, under the cork tree, sitting just quietly smelling the flowers.”

The righteous citizens are angered by the conspiracy for the greater good, mass madness, and for political gain.</p>

Stare into speckled night sky
Atmospheric space</p>

<p>As the Sahara dunes pile around us, our caravan weaves between still waves. The rust color of the sand reflects into the gaseous air and a green mix comes back down to us. It lives among us and we among it.</p>

<p>I don’t trust the strangers here with me in the middle of the world.</p>

<p>The green gases and deep blue from the sky seep together into the densest night I’ve ever witnessed. I grip the rope tightly and painfully sway as the camel steps and sinks into the sand. Shifting from one side to the other, I lose balance while staring up into the abyss. I am tired and the darkness is difficult for us all to press through.</p>

<p>The night draws on as my eyelids get closer without me noticing. It isn’t until they clamp down on a view of the horizon that I realize the complete darkness. I’m too far in my own head or too lost in this cold desert sphere. This is what I’ve imagined when I lay awake at night.</p>

My elbow is resting in a small puddle on the table, but I ignore the dampness on my clothes. Instead, I focus on the conversation.</p>

<p>Conversations like these are few and far between. It’s expansive and rewarding and challenging all at the same time. I hate parties because I’m not good at being superficial. Thankfully, this conversation is anything but. The bass echoes off the tile floor and low-hanging ceiling. There’s loud yelling back and forth between crowded people, which doesn’t make it any easier to listen.</p>

<p>He travels on his own like I do. He’s seen much of Europe and its cities, and recognizes the value of exploring alone. Traveling like this is an expression of vulnerability that changes the way that others perceive you. However, traveling alone can change the course of your life only if you let it.</p>

<p>I want to be as vulnerable as possible, but I struggle to convey the emotions I feel in meeting someone from across the globe who is so similar to me. It’s a bizarre idea, but I could have this same conversation with myself. Our perspectives are very similar.</p>

<p>No matter what words I use to explain what two mirrors held face to face look like, I will never be able to express either the effect of seeing the glass, or what it feels like unless you’ve seen it yourself. Even if you’ve seen it, maybe your experience was different. Maybe you do know what infinity looks like, but it actually was a totally negligible moment in your life. Maybe you aren’t as impressed by theoretical distance as I am. So, it is true for this little act of storytelling. It consists of me repeating brief moments over and over in my head as I try to pick the perfect adjective to characterize the action, the speaker, or the moment. This book is my attempt to capture the experiences that have changed my life. I want so badly to share them with you. I know, however, that their power will be lost in translation from my eyes to your head, much like holding two mirrors held face to face.</p>

            </div>
                
            <div class="content_div"><p>Today has been my last day in Marseille. I cleaned my room and gathered my bags, now much more filled than they were when I arrived. I’ve packed my belongings around an elk antler that is slightly longer and taller than the size of my duffle bag. I got it from Paris and lovingly carried this oblong pointy thing back to my apartment by way of trains and buses, where it was ceremoniously rested atop my wardrobe. Now the antler nearly bursts the seams of my bag. I can only hope it will make it through security and back to the U.S. This evening I’ll leave Luminy and make my way to the edge of Marseille for my flight out of the country. My plane leaves at six in the morning; public transportation won’t be able to get me there that early, so I’ve decided to enjoy a night at the airport.</p>

<p>Until then however, I’ll spend my last few hours with my closest friends down the street. We make dinner, spend time reminiscing and laughing, and make plans to get back together in the States. I don’t really know what these friendships will look like back home. I don’t know if we’ll actually get back together, but I want to. I have cherished our time because the months we’ve spent together were radical moments in our lives. Our relationships are unique, unexpected, and empowering. Taiwo, Keha, and I sit on the balcony after dinner and watch the fluid sky change colors and set too quickly. We laugh through our evident sadness until the coastal breeze makes it too cold to stay outside. We bring the dishes in to clean, shutting the sliding glass door behind us.</p>

<p>I look back to where I began and am proud of my progress. I turn back to the glass door only to see the reflections of the wall, the foyer, and the front door to the apartment now behind me. I realize now that the only direction to go is forward.
The twins walk me to the familiar covered bench on the side of the street, and when the bus arrives, I leave.</p>

            </div>
                
            <div class="content_div"><p>Over the course of the past year, I’ve read through this book quite a few times. I’ve thought about the moments these words capture. I think about the wine, the small apartment, the dim desk lamp I wrote beneath, and about the wine some more. I think about the journals, the tickets, the maps I burned through, and then about where I began. I am there again but this time it looks different, and it feels different, and it will never be the same now that I know what it’s like to live another way.</p>

<p>I’ve learned many things in this process of writing. These are a few:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned how much harder I make things in my head. Getting on a plane and finding my way through the bizarre streets of a foreign country, mentally converting currency, and financing and surviving a trip is difficult. Difficult, but not impossible. Pushing myself to experience something great seemed like a fantasy until I did exactly that. It seemed impossible until I made the experience priority, until I committed myself to a dream and made steps toward achieving it. I gained an unprecedented sense of ability and freedom. I realized big fears were unfounded and that I am more capable than I feel comfortable giving myself credit for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned how tough it is to return home. Our familiar hometown is never as endearing as it is when we can’t go back. Sooner or later, our return will be accompanied by well-intended friends asking what’s next and where we’re headed. Geographically? Metaphorically? I don’t know what they mean. Those first few days back from France when I still lived out of a suitcase started to feel like a bad crash after a high-on-life experience. I’ve learned that when people ask what is next for me, I can find comfort in the unknown. I didn’t know what tomorrow looked like in Europe or what great stories would come from this first year back in the U.S. I don’t know what’s coming next, but today is almost over and I still have work to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned that it’s important to appreciate what you can’t document. There are things that photos won’t do justice to. I refused to take photographs of certain sites, rooms, and moments because of the intimacy and respect some experiences demand. Imagine the difference pulling out my camera would have made in speaking with Ed and Danny. I refused to take photos inside sanctuaries because I know that their nature is not congruent with the celebrity of photography. I can do them no justice and I wouldn’t dare try. I’ve learned to stop trying to preserve and eternalize things. I grew in my appreciation of small fleeting moments and became more sensitive of the details. I’ve learned to cherish the invisible gusts of wind that send chills down my spine. I’ll never forget the chattering cold night. I now have appreciation for the sunrise not as it looks, but as it feels — as I experience it and as it is perceived. No camera will ever capture those feelings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned to listen closely to nonverbal communication. When I gestured my way for directions (mostly to restrooms), I realized body language counts for so much of how we understand one each other. I became largely aware of my body language when it was the only way I could get things done. This has allowed me to more intentionally communicate with my body and face.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned to listen even more closely to instinct. I remember leading a group through the treacherous alleys of the medina in Fes at night. It was very dark. Never before had I leaned so far into my gut than in moments like those. It’s much more important to rely on instinct in those circumstances because you have no other choice. When you learn to trust yourself, the voice inside starts growing larger. I became so familiar with it that I was able to predict my decisions before threats were presented. I became more aware of my decision-making style and am able to make choices more in line with my natural instinct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Say what you mean, mean what you say. If the answer is ‘yes,’ say so and just that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned the appeal of utility. I remember putting bags and bags of my belongings on the plane to return to the U.S. I remember paying a great deal of extra money getting them back over. I look at the clothes I bought while abroad and realize that bringing them home was not worth their value now. I’ve begun wearing much simpler clothes everyday, such as neutral colors to match and quality pieces that last. How easy it would have been to have adopted simple t-shirts and layers while abroad. I would have had more room to bring back artifacts that I wouldn’t have outgrown or torn a hole in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who become most important in your life will come in unexpected ways and times. There are two kinds of friendships. The first you form out of convenience. The second you maintain despite inconvenient time zones, work schedules, and everything else. From what I’ve seen, the second matter more. You can’t predict where your friends will come from and so I try to be as open as possible. You can’t set out with the intention of finding friends because friendships just happen, and they mean more than makes sense. Despite time and location, the value of great friendships never change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned that a comfort zone is only an illusionary wall. There is no need to break the wall down. Just take a deep breath in and, with confidence, take the first step through.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned that the way in which I was raised is not the only way. The cultural dynamics of Europe are much more far-reaching than the limited American perspective. When I immersed myself in another culture, I realized that the standards I was holding myself to were subjective and could be challenged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned to be like Ferdinand. I would rather stop and smell the flowers than furiously check off cities from a list. The ‘must sees’ for one person aren’t the same for another. You aren’t any more or less travelled than someone else because you haven’t seen Milan or Amsterdam yet. There is always time to explore. If you want to, you will make it happen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I discovered what I need more of in my regular life. The places I most wanted to visit were telling of my personality. I learned that I deeply desire to be around people, despite spending most of my time travelling alone. Even though I convinced myself that it would be cool and understated to be introverted, I know now that I have extroverted tendencies. When I figured out what the most vital aspects of my personality were, I learned to incorporate them into my daily life even when I wasn’t traveling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I learned what I desire to return to and where home is. By experiencing bittersweet pangs of sadness, I learned that my closest friends are more important to me that I care to admit. I’ve learned that I am deeply invested in my friendships, and that I thrive on relationship-building, community, and vulnerability. I was surprised by who and what I missed when I was away. Home takes on a new meaning, sometimes even multiple meanings. Home is a country, home is a person, home is a place, or a restaurant, or a community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned that there is always a reason not to go. If you’re searching for a reason, you’ll find one, or many.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned exactly how little I know. I don’t know what I don’t know, and that in and of itself is a boggling thing to say. I was surprised by the number of places I had never heard of, the concepts for which English had no words, and the ways of speaking that I can’t pick up no matter how many times or how slowly I ask for them to be repeated. I am in awe of the knowledge of the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned to love being alone. Whether I was by myself for an eight-hour flight, eating lunch at a café, shopping in town, or the only person in the room who spoke English, I was challenged and rewarded by the experience. I learned to better understand myself after I removed all other elements of familiarity. I stepped away from my family, friends, goals, culture, career, and instead focused on myself and my day. I learned to love every day and respect it as an adventure. 
I learned to love the life I lead. No one will facilitate a perfect lifetime itenerary for me and I refuse to wait for others to show me the world. Through my travels, I realized that I am responsible for the destination of my journey.</p>
