It swells to infect my lungs and I gasp for air. My chest is tight and reluctant to lift. When I lie in bed at night, breathing is hard and my head is twisting into some complicated shape I can’t define. My body has corners that come together to make impossible intersections. Their existence cannot be outside of my imagination, but I am conviced otherwise.</p>

<p>I am changing, perhaps faster than I can take and faster than I can understand. Here, then there, I am made from pieces coming from all sides bound to a central point. It’s complicated and out of my control. What do I do with knowledge that can’t be defined? What is to be said about new and indescribable existence?</p>

<p>Although I see the contortion, I am confused; distracted, rather, by the arms and legs spewing from the thick knot.</p>

I’ll follow up in March and see if that would be a good time for you to provide responses or if you’d like to wait a bit. Also, if you have a headshot and/or any pictures of the university and your study abroad experience, we would love to include those as well. Thank you very much for your help with this. I’ll be sure to let you know when the article is published.</p>

<p>Please tell me all about your study abroad trip. I want to know what you are studying/ what classes are you taking and how does this apply to your major? Why did you choose Kedge in Marseille, France? How long will you be there?”</p>

<p>Courses: Organizational Behavior, Principles of Marketing, Sustainable Development, Management Information Systems</p>

<p>KEDGE Business School is within the top circle for the Grand Ecole system in France. It is a well-respected college on an international level and has a local reputation of being reserved for the best in the city. Marseille itself is the second largest city in France. The Vieux Port was among the first in the world to link intercontinental trade and has been the business hub of the continent and much of the world for 26 centuries. Its location is the access point across the Mediterranean Sea to trade in North Africa and the Middle East. Both of these areas and their many cultures are represented here. While the strict French typecast is present, there is a much broader level of international diversity in the streets, businesses, and the KEDGE campus. It’s similar to GMU in a lot of ways and I do feel that the diversity in our school has prepared me for international life like this.</p>

<p>“Which study abroad programs did you look at and why did you choose the one you did?”</p>

<p>There weren’t many options for me. I’ve studied French for four years and am committed to putting French fluency on my resume. This commitment lead me to KEDGE. It’s a direct exchange program which makes the application and credit transfer very simple. I told myself that if I was going to learn a language, I was going to learn it from its source, and this city and the people have been very helpful in getting me to that point. I’ve developed familiarity with the language much more than I’ve been able to in the classroom.</p>

<p>“What are you looking forward to most during this experience? What do you anticipate being your key takeaway from this trip- personally and to apply to the business world?”</p>

<p>This trip has presented me with many great opportunities. The one I look forward to most is celebrating Easter at St. Peter’s Square with Pope Francis. In only two months, however, I’ve been able to do some incredible things. I’ve toured South France, skied the Alps, learned French from native speakers, rented my first apartment, thrived in global diversity, developed my career, and made connections that will last long after I touch back down at Dulles. A concise list is no longer possible because my time abroad has developed nearly every part of my personality. I set out with the goal to consolidate the traits of my role model. I’ve done that and more.</p>

<p>“Any advice for students considering studying abroad at Mason?”</p>

<p>Studying abroad is a commitment that anyone who is considering surely realizes. My advice before making any serious decision is to make sure that the product sits well with your head and your heart. If the three don’t make sense together, you’ll eventually reach a point where you question your decision. If you question, you’ll be led to doubt and doubt leads to regret. The last thing you want to do is regret being alone on a flight out of the country for half a year.</p>

<p>There has to be purpose for you to study abroad, whether it’s for credits toward your degree or for the language. Logically justify why you want to do it and what it will do for you. Secondly, make sure you’re emotionally invested in the challenge. Love the idea of what the time away will do to you, set goals to keep yourself on track, and be prepared to be uncomfortable nearly every day while you’re away. Know that things will go wrong and you will miss whatever you’ve left back home.</p>

<p>“What does it mean to you to be awarded the Gilman Scholarship? Can you tell me a bit about the application process for you?”</p>

<p>It means a great deal to have been given the Gilman Scholarship. I’ve taken a piece from the last paragraph of one of my application essays. I spoke honestly when I said:</p>

<p>“I will proudly carry the name of Mr.Gilman. Receiving his scholarship would alleviate the costs of the exchange, but more than that, it would reaffirm solidarity within myself… The ever-prevalent idea that we are the ultimate determinants of our own happiness is nothing without the participation of others…”</p>

<p>The Gilman International Scholarship sees what I am doing. They’ve read my intentions as I carefully poured my heart into their essay windows and they stand behind my endeavors. Their support is invaluable. No matter how much I want to be independent and for success to come by my own hand, we will be able to achieve more, faster, when we learn to be interdependent.</p>

<p>By looking to Gilman for help, I was required to be vulnerable and to put myself on the line. It cost me time and a lot of it. I spent at least an hour a day for the better part of the summer months writing the essays, hunting for the most concise way to speak about the depth of my past, and the goals I have for the future. 
“What has been your favorite experience while studying abroad thus far?”</p>

<p>I’ve recently returned from London with some students at KEDGE. The Commission des Opérations Boursières et Financiers (COBFI) is one of the school’s business organizations. It has just paired with the London School of Economics (LSE) and got our group a spot in a lecture with some professors from the University. Professor Alan Manning and Nicola Smith lead a discussion afterwards that gave me insight to the differences between the US minimum wage and the UK wage. It’s been interesting to see the differences between cultures in the most basic parts of society. These are the things I have never thought of any differently and, frankly, didn’t think any other way existed.</p>

<p>The day after the lecture at LSE we toured London, I had some time with a few friends I met in Barcelona, and the evening was spent in the Bloomberg London offices. I’m not a math person. I barely got out of Hylton’s accounting class and yet I really enjoyed my time with the company. While the majority of the evening was spent talking numbers and using the Bloomberg Terminal, I was able to break away from the group and sit down at the workspace with one of the company’s marketing project managers. She and I spoke about her daily schedule, opportunities within the company, and also about my potential involvement. In this meeting I got well-needed perspective and am tempted to write about how this experience is going to change my career concretely.</p>

<p>The truth is that I don’t know exactly what is to come for me and this semester has made me fully understand that. I work hard and get involved with those things I think are admirable, but truthfully I only have intuition to go off of. What I do know now is that I’m on the cusp of some big opportunities, the likes of which I didn’t think would come so soon. My goals grow very fast and I’m told, “go big or go home, right?” I’ve decided I don’t want to go home.</p>

I sit and stare blankly, noticing the momentary speckles of falling dust. They glisten. I’m at peace until a strange man steps into the sanctuary. He’s dressed in all black but is not a priest. He looks tiny because the ceiling hangs and looms ominously above his dusty brown head. His soft-heeled shoes make more sound than they should in this quiet place. It’s early evening. The tranquil specks drift through the stained light that gleam in the fading sun. Heel, toe, heel, toe, with purpose and pattern, his steps break the air. My neck turns so my eyes can follow him. He reaches the center of the marble altar, clicks his ankles together, and bends at the waist in a way that makes me think that he cracked his spine in a few places. He straightens his back, puts his hands down to his side, and continues on his way. He steps diagonally up onto the altar and then to the lectern.</p>

<p>I’ve finally found the buzzing sound. It is the anxiety that sparsely fills the void from the high-backed pews to the ceiling. The man touches the little microphone once and it reacts to him three times. Sounds of his finger echoes down the aisle. The wiring whines as it is probed to stand taller and nearly touch the man’s lips. He steps away and leaves its space. He moves back, following his old footsteps exactly. I follow him back across the altar and watch as he leaves the room.</p>

<p>I look back to the lectern. The buzzing grows, cycling through the microphone and speakers, starting at a mumble and then turning into a pitched hum. It is a subtle call for help that sounds with more and more haste. It swells until it loses its innocent tickle. The mouth widens and the chords rub against one another. Some treacherous being has come from the dark crypts below. Its cold stone teeth and stained-glass eyes widen with ferocity. It rises through the floor and violently erupts with ash and dust. The screams from the damsel fill the room and multiply on their way back and forth between the walls. The bitter black particles flood the space and then collapse over the soundwaves.</p>

<p>Her echoes are abruptly suppressed and silence moves back in. The once prismatic windows are now shattered. The man in black comes back. She quietly begs for his help. Kneeling before him and wrapping her hand around the back of his leg, she gently touches his chin. He is not moved. Removing her arm from his body and circling around, he covers her mouth and pulls her back into the slow-moving, billowy ash.</p>

<p>The dust settles, there’s a low hum, and cold reverb moves back through the room.</p>

            </div>   
            <div class="content_div"><p>In the top tier of the coliseum, I lay out under the sun. For the first time in a long time, I can feel the heat from the sun directly and without shivery, oceanic winds interrupting. My arm is bent to use my hand as a pillow between the wide stone slab and the back of my head. I twist my neck to look down into the sand pit below.</p>

<p>Sand covers the middle of the Roman arenas so that when it is churned, it will mask the smell of blood. The dignitaries, the cheerers, the politicians, and the other onlookers bet on the few fighters that play to kill in a game of glory, but can not stomach the consequences. They mix the sand to cover the blood. I think about dying; more specifically, martyrdom. The sand in the center soaks up the blood of both the hunted animals and criminals. This is a place that you enter knowing that you may not leave. Your life is gambled for either fame or demise.</p>

<p>I think to my future visit to Rome itself, and then the Vatican. Am I walking into a coliseum with a square center? I reflect on the publicized threat of terrorism and then on my own death. I see it happen. I watch myself die several times, in several ways. A lion enters through the gates and men prod it to step out into the light of the arena. I see the death of children and visualize myself fighting for the lives of the others around me. I am ultimately bloodied and captured beneath the feet of opposition. I see smoke and tears, grimacing faces, and white light turning red. I feel the pain of laceration, torture, and morbid dehumanization.</p>

<p>We say there is new life in Christ, but only through physical death. Only death motivates those who oppose the Church. Masses file into the ring and wait for the game to start. It begins with some shadowy beast pouncing out of the dark. The spectacle is dramatic and ostentatious, within the true sense of showmanship. There is an explosion of dust and my vision fails. We can see outlines but cannot clarify bodies because these nouveau- Romans brought tear gas. There is jeering and booing until the first blood is shed; then come the wails of death. Tooth and nail first pierces the skin of those who are chained by fear. They are bound to the pillars by which they stand. They die before the rest while others try to get away. Father puts up a fight. Mother covers her babies as her back is torn to shreds. Blood and spine separate and red splatters in our eyes. Children watch as their mothers are disassembled and color soles like water-based paints. These stains won’t be cleaned. The son’s tears don’t last forever because his brain isn’t receiving oxygen. Father failed. The beast moves and multiplies, pulling apart from itself. Family, single, couple, layperson, teacher, or priest; different yet all the same to the only eyes that matter in St. Peter’s Square.</p>

<p>Their name, ISIS, s with hate, and is praised across the border. All hail and celebrate how this authority was dethroned in style and irony. I see the red and then the black. I begin to realize the severity of my choice for the coming weeks. Courage is the scale of martyrdom. None of them entered into the coliseum knowing that they would leave. That’s not how the Word works.</p>

<p>The turmoil of our lives must be faced with faith and conviction. Without this understanding, we are invertebrates too passive to fight. I will fight for the life that I want. I ask myself, “Am I willing to leave those people back home?” “Am I ready to be vulnerable for the sake of my convictions?” Lord knows that I can’t say, and I surely can’t write it down. I do know that I head to the Valley and that this Easter may end my life.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>I will be there. With all that I have, with what I do not, with all of my gifts and talents, with my love and devotion, with my thoughts, and with my brothers and my mother in mind. I will go because it is my passion. Suddenly, these writings have more purpose. These words make sense and my body is filled with reason and value that is tangible beyond my understanding. I am more than gold in city streets or water in the desert. I am more than failing flesh and rotting bone. What I do has value. God, that hasn’t been easy to say for the last 20 years. I would never deny it but I could never believe it. It is still hard to accept love, but right now love means something real. This value has weight, matter, scale, and presence because You have shown it to me over these past months. This love swells my insides until I can no longer ignore it. My heart sways heavily and my back bends from the burden. There is new balance. It keeps my chest down and my lungs tight. I move to the altar and breathe to my capacity.</p>

<p>I must become better for the sake of my world. I tremble at the thought of surviving in second light. In death, there is new life. That is what You tell me and what You give me. You tell me that when I die, my life will be worth more than the business I do, the money I make, and the constructions I lead. If I change one heart, it will be worth it. I dwell on home and love. My friends and family: Mom, Matthew, Daniel, Ian, Hunter, Doe, Kez, Snek, Clem, and Kalna. I think of K, Marijka, Kalia, and Mace, Patty, Iz, and Emmie. I think of the ones I’ve let into my life. I am thankful for the ones given to me to share my time with. The times we’ve had together are worth any struggle. The time we have shared is valuable because the scale of eternity tilts with the weight of a beloved memory.</p>

<p>What kills me is that now is too perfect of a time to die. I love how You complete me even though I am now broken. I love the way You give my life purpose. These random pieces are connected through one vein. Your blood runs through every part of me when I am completely convicted. You’ve shown me what trust looks like in the past three months. You’ve shown me interdependence. You’ve shown me what the product of our union is through the work of my own hands. You’ve shown me that what I called “imperfection” can be made perfect. You’ve shown me loss and desolation. You have never failed to show me the view from the highest mountain. You’ve shown me the work of Your hands, and I try to give you the work of mine. I follow Your fingers and the center of Your palm. I follow Your footsteps as You lead me. I have not traveled alone for a single moment. I shiver in the warmth I never thought I deserved. I question my reality because it is created and planned by someone else. Life is beautiful beyond my current understanding. My choices and feelings that I call my own are not just mine. I don’t have the intelligence to verbalize these conclusions, leaving me in awe of the splendid world.</p>

For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.</p>

I am not in control and she changed me. She changes me into something shaky and uncomposed. I don’t want to talk about myself when I listen to her because I know my voice. I want to understand hers.

I’ve seen more money move in a few days than ever before. I remember when I was a kid and thought a lot of money was $20. That quickly became $100, $100 become $1,000, and now it sits at $10,000. When I was 15 and first received paychecks, the cash coming my way made me feel like a king for a day. Here in Paris, I’m looking at price tags marked at $14,000 for an ugly bag or $15,000 for a watch. I will never forget witnessing the flippant decision between two four-digit and equally useless (and ugly) handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I could justify any of these purchases at any point in my life. These thousands of euros, dollars, and pounds (of flesh) could change the life of someone else. For $10,000, the price of two semesters at university, I could get a man off the streets and bring him to self-sufficiency. I could develop 3rd world communities and change the standards of living for hundreds of people with $15,000. My eyes and my head can’t comprehend the blind vision of the lucky few buying Givenchy, Bulgari, Fendi, Fendi, Louis, Louis, Prada trash.</p>

And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,</p>

<p>And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.”</p>

When I kiss the cheeks of these new friends in France, it doesn’t mean as much as it would with the people I separated myself from. As incredible as these new friends are, they are sometimes only painful reminders of how far away I am from home.</p>

<p>I realize now that the ‘baggage’ I brought with me is not as negative as it sounds. I left with myself in mind and had a striking openness to the world. The life I have is good. It is so good, in fact, that I want to be there more than here. Granted, I’m in my cold apartment writing for an underwhelming economics class. I know I won’t feel the same on the weekend or when I get on a plane to some new city.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>It’s late and I watch the sun set with disappointment. I still don’t know where I’m staying tonight. I may bring myself to find a place, but I’ll probably convince myself otherwise. I am pushed onto the streets against my will just like I thought and dreamed. I face the west. Despite what I want, ambition keeps me to my word. “It’s one night,” I tell myself. It’s one out of a thousand that the homeless face. My internal conflict switches sides quickly and I lean back and forth. The eight euros that I spent on my hostel for the night weigh heavily on my mind. It’s cold, it’s not safe, and someone could steal my backpack if I fall asleep. If my phone and wallet were taken from me, I would feel it in the pit of my stomach for months to come. The money and documentation that were so difficult to obtain would be a nightmare to replace. I realize that I am risking more than just my possessions.
My heart is torn between two individuals. Half belongs to the person that I want to be, while the other to the person that I am now. I give reason after reason to escape this self-deprecating inner conversation. Every time, however, my conscience comes full circle and keeps me involved. This vicious cycle resorts back to one idea consistently: “I am not intimidated by the devil.” I battle between the choice of bed or concrete. My hip flexor, my blisters, and my knee all twinge painfully. I lean on the short stone wall that overlooks the river and hang my head low between my shoulders.</p>

<p>While I do not know what will happen, I choose to face the streets tonight. It surely goes against the advice of all others back home and their response may be resoundingly negative when they find out. Tomorrow my decision will be justified. I will have perspective and experience, which I value beyond the threat to my safety. I didn’t think I would make it to Italy, yet here I am alive and well. Here begins life like it won’t last.</p>

<p>I step in for dinner at a humble cafe. The gelato there is old and served after being frozen. The sandwiches look decent but aren’t substantial. Since this small place doesn’t have enough seating for the few people inside, I offer the open table beside me to the couple who followed me in. They invite me to join them and so I do. We don’t talk at first because they speak Dutch. They talk back and forth as I listen quietly. She has some pink gelato and he drinks a beer. I chuckle at his jokes and after a game of charades, find out that they are leisurely travelling now that their kids are at university. They learn that I’m studying in Marseille. She calls for their check, and they get up to leave. We say our goodbyes and I stay to pass time.</p>

<p>After wearing off my welcome, I get up to pay the man behind the glass counter. Two men (one in the front of the cafe and the other now in the back) throw some Italian across the restaurant and inform me that the couple I sat with paid for my dinner. I welcome back the 8 euros spent on the empty hostel bed I reserved.</p>

<p>21:01 
I’m thinking about tomorrow morning. The only thing I have on my schedule is Mass at 8:30 at St. Peter’s Basilica. There are 12 hours until then. I’ve only just begun this long night and my eyes are aching already. I imagine the sunrise in my head, which pains my irises as if I’m actually looking at it. I get on a bus, mostly to rest. I woke up this morning at 8:00 and rushed out of the door to the airport. That was 12 hours ago. I realize that I am in the dead center, exactly where I hate to be. I cringe at the thought as it begins to lose balance. The driver mechanically steps on the gas long before I’ve made my way to the back. I catch myself and grab the dirty handrail hanging down from the roof of the bus. I sit down, noticing my reflection and the shallow bags beneath my eyes. I look at my palms. Using the public transportation here is giving me warts on my hands. It’s been 10 years since my fingers had warts on them and three are back since I’ve been in Europe.</p>

<p>I underestimated how much happened in public at night. As if it doesn’t exist and as if nothing happens just because I’ve never spent a night alone in the dark. I realize how far-stretched, long, and sleepless tonight will be. I’m sitting on edge, under fluorescent lights, as the night only just begins. All I can think to do is ride the bus for as long as I can.</p>

<p>The bus gets crowded. I stand for a while listening to conversations in languages I don’t speak. I am desperately far from being able to experience life through their eyes as I am outside of comprehension. Eavesdropping is a luxury I’ve long been stripped of. Although I’m around others, I can’t relate to anything that’s being said: the drama, the plans, and the nicely dressed people heading to a table set for two. I’m not a part of their world. I’m an American — a sad, barely bilingual American who is pretty far out of water, trying to take in air that’s not made for him. The bus breathes freely, however. I can feel the city’s life as the crowds fluctuate in and out. It all looks so different now, like they have privilege which magnifies my lack thereof. I feel lessened in the presence of others, as if I could stick out more than I already do.</p>

<p>These damned curvy yellow plastic bus seats along with the cold hard interior of the bus become more and more uncomfortable over time. The form-fitting spine of the chair supports the human body at first, but after a while feels painfully unnatural. This environment was made with the worst intentions. It’s as if it was made to be as uncomfortable as possible so people like me wouldn’t want to stay. Nonetheless, I stay as long as I can because it’s a safe haven. I ride the bus until the end of its line and am kicked off in a foreign language. It’s unexpectedly over.</p>

<p>I don’t have the words to explain desertion. I don’t know how to punctuate the gross abandonment I felt in the pit of my stomach when the engine of the bus cut. As if the fuel for the bus was the same that kept me running, I feel the engine die in the center of my chest. I descend into the cosmic black parking lot. There are two cars at the edge of the light and no other people around once the bus driver leaves. The stars above don’t mean anything and the lights of the apartment buildings shut me out. Scattered puddles mirror the speckled lights above them and ambiguate the line between the tar lot and the blacker night sky. It’s just past midnight and the mystery of everything, all at once, is multiplied by the lack of light and direction. I feel the wind and cold easily move through my jean jacket and t–shirt. The written words on signs and maps don’t make sense and I don’t know where to begin in piecing them together. My body, my head, and my heart have lost any sense of navigation here at some suburban outpost.</p>

<p>I tell myself my name is no longer my own and that I am someone new in order to cope. I’ll do anything to disconnect myself from who I am as a protective measure (whether this is protection from myself or from someone else, I don’t know). I know, however, that I don’t want this experience attached to my name anymore because it’s turning out to be much more intimidating that I originally imagined. I don’t want to make a decision or have to pick between right or left when both equally lead to shit. I don’t want to choose, lose, and then regret not taking the other, as if it could have been better. I am no one trying to outwit reflections of myself in puddles. I try to make it to sunrise because it’s the only thing I have to look forward to. Because suddenly my home is in church and I have no other seat reserved for me. That is the only thing I have to look forward to-take me off the streets and into those walls.</p>

<p>–:– 
I walk away from homes because I fear the moment a face turns the corner in front of me. I replay a moment like this several times to desensitize myself from the fear that would course through my body. I tell myself that when it happens I need to keep my mouth closed and my eyes focused, and carefully calculate how my limbs will react. I decide between fight or flight in preparation. Apartments spread out into windy neighborhoods and my mind meticulously keeps track of everything that I see. Graffiti and grass spew through cracks in the concrete. I’m led by the road into Roman suburbia, with my hands shoved into my pockets to keep them from the cold. I clench them tightly into fists and look up at a wide street sign. Its white background bends iridescent reflections of scattered lights.</p>

<p>My eyes lie. They speak of focus and purpose, both of which I am without. In a hyperactive state, my senses do all they can to protect me from threats. I can see behind myself when I hear engine noises and can feel lights press against my neck. I piece these hints together in my head and expect them as they approach. The lights of this on-coming car inspect me, along with the driver behind them. I clench my jaw tightly and sharpen my eyes. I fib my way through with my body language and the car moves past me, sending a shiver down my spine that causes me to stand straighter than before. I walk slower now, although I try to keep my pace up to maintain body heat. The buildings space out further and further until I see the end of the street lights quickly approaching. I stare once more into starry sky and empty earth. I continue forward, leaving the world in which I once dwelt. 
I am no longer affixed by the time or standards that measure days. I am now a part of a mindset without metrics, because I am only concerned for myself and for my protection. People have become opponents. I move out of time and into the spaciousness of experiences.</p>

<p>A black car approaches me slowly, much slower than the others before. It barely rolls at my walking speed. Suddenly it is beside me. The driver even made the effort to blacken the rims and darken the windows. The light of pale faces is barely visible through the window. I look and they look too. I stare into the window. With my eyes strong and my jaw tight, I communicate one message to the man as he looks back: “I am not scared of you.” I speak the truth. He passes me, pulls a U–turn back the other way, and accelerates away from me. I don’t know where he’s decided to go or if I’ll see his return. I don’t want to find out. I pull the straps on my backpack and quickly cross the street over to the sidewalk. I cross through several alleys and resolve to find a spot to lie low for a while. Here, where nature begins to mix with residence, I come across an alcove made of hedges and neatly-kept trees between the street and someone’s home. I cross through into the backyard and, after the branches return to their stillness and the last of the leaves hit the ground, it is finally quiet again. My breathing slows down. 
The windows of the house are dim. I am thankful to have come across this backyard just as the houses began to get more sparse down. God, I am glad there are no dogs here because I hear them echoing across the night above me. There’s a parked car on the stone driveway that winds up a curving hill. It goes around the side of the house and away from the street that I came from. It’s perfect, but in a perfect world I wouldn’t be doing this. A small, single-wide gate crosses just in front of me with a sign hanging from it. I can’t read what it says, however. I step closer to the sign, brushing past overgrown hedgerows. There’s an icon of a video surveillance system that gets a quick reaction out of me as soon as I figure it out. I back up recklessly, making a senseless ruckus. I ask myself where it is that I plan to go. I’m not leaving. If they are home, they’re asleep; if they aren’t home, they will watch the video in the morning and I’ll be gone. Nothing’s happened so far, no alarms have gone off, and I’m not going to let a sign keep me from the best spot I’ve found all night, yet another makeshift safe haven. I’ve found my way to my room.</p>

<p>It’s a narrow space, a kind of hall between street and yard. The worn and used path is faded to dirt. I get down on one knee, one palm on the ground and the other pressing on my knee. I pause to think about what I’m doing.</p>

<p>I continue down to the ground. I am still wearing my backpack as I move from one knee, to sitting, to laying on my side. At first, the relief to my body is pleasant. My head rests on the back of my hands and my nose is parallel with the ground. I can see my breath mix with the dirt that it moves. The smell of dirt reminds me of when my brothers and I were younger and of how we spent long sunny days building forts in the woods. We were a team of four along with some friends, setting out with a mission to build something. We would divide tasks, collect materials, and build based on talent. We knew our positions— although the youngest brother never seemed happy with his. Someone had to do those jobs and he got over it eventually. Maybe not that day, but after sleeping it over in the night, his anger was forgotten. Time passes in remembering.</p>

<p>The tip of my nose is getting cold. I breathe out of my mouth, into my palms cupped over my face. My left side chills against the ground. Comfortable becomes cold and colder. Minutes seem stuck in time. I shiver with the seconds. My arms are crossed and my jean jacket is buttoned up tight against my gut. The top button at the collar is open so that I can tuck my nose inside and trap heat. My muscles tighten, my legs are crookedly bent, and my feet writhe in pain.</p>

<p>Time isn’t passing fast enough, so I close my eyes and listen. I see the cars drive by in my head once more. I feel their headlights through my skin. They speed past me as I lay on the ground in the dirt in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>A twig cracks and frightens my eyes open. I didn’t have a choice whether or not to keep them closed. I lay still while my eyes dart quickly, looking for reason. They find nothing, and slowly and suspiciously close again. Just as my eyelashes meet in the middle, a painful probing light catches them and pulls them back. Every detail, every color, every overexposed leaf, shines in brightness. They are unnatural, unreal, and all too real at the same time. Every fold in my clothes is deepened in shadow and colored in full. I look toward the light as a car pulls into the driveway straight towards me. It’s 10 meters away and moving in my direction. I throw my head back and hide my face, trying to look like anything but a person sleeping in a corner of their yard. I tuck my feet into brush and get as still as I can. The car comes closer and the engine gets louder. The face I pictured the car having towers over me. I lie like a fool, but it sees straight through me. The shape of the car grows in ferocity and settles just past my gate to the house. The engine sputters. The two in the car step down onto the gravel and speak a language I wish I knew. They walk slowly as they make way from the car to the house. Clearer and clearer, as if they are getting closer, I can hear the thick stones being kicked around one by one. There are no voices, but the sound of feet moving. And then nothing. I think I am alone again.</p>

<p>Time passes. I am emotionally exhausted. What seemed like a long time has only been a couple of hours. The closest thing I’ll get to sleep tonight is a sort of mix between consciousness and daze, through which I blankly lay. My mind can’t choose between one or the other, so I remain in sheer pain. My whole body shakes uncontrollably. No bigger blanket, no extra jacket, nothing else but to deal with it. The pain grows incrementally over time, until I give up. I angrily get to my feet and leave the area without looking back. With more aggression than necessary, I hit the dirt and leaves from my clothes as I walk away. I don’t know where I’m going.</p>

<p>–:– 
I continue on, walking past the last house. I turn onto the highway leading out of the city. Morning dew condenses as I walk through the tall uncut grasses in the middle of the median. While my feet are getting soaked, I find some happiness in witnessing the formation of morning dew. I shiver and my teeth chatter. A car approaches me from behind and sounds its horn until it passes me. No doubt, the driver was trying to warn me of the dangers of walking on the highway. I see a sign for a campground and decide to make my way there. I follow the arrows. I cross the empty three–lane street and climb out of the highway, through sobbing grasses and up a steep dirt footpath. I head towards the front entrance of the camping complex and find the community washhouse. Its warm light spills out of the open doors. I pick up my pace, looking out for security, or for any sign of life. I’m not sure if this is a reasonable time to be out. I don’t belong here. I’m not paying for campsite privileges, but I’ve forgotten that they don’t know that.</p>

<p>I quietly enter the men’s side of the washhouse and scan the building for movement. I detect none, but my footsteps echo. I want so badly to sit beneath hot water for the rest of the night but I can’t. Finding a towel, making noises, and risking blatant detachment from my belongings would make the rest of the night far more difficult than necessary. I resort to warming my body with hot water on my face and hands, then leave after using the bathroom. I hope to find some place to stay nearby to claim for the remaining hours, but I don’t see any in sight. I explore the grounds and find individual apartment buildings. I see tents, some RVs, and plenty of small European cars clustered in a distant parking lot. It’s dark and I’m not in the state of mind to build a proper mental map of this place. I am powered by intuition, looking for any place that might serve as protection. I think I’ve found what I’m looking for when I open the door of the laundry room. None of the machines are running, but it’s warm and somehow noisy. I follow the walls searching for a place to lodge myself for a few hours, but find none. I circle the room twice and notice that there’s a large frosted window and door in the room leading to an office. It’s the ground’s security office. A still blue light from a computer is suddenly blocked by a blurry body moving in the direction of the door. I leave as quickly and quietly as I can.</p>

<p>I leave the room and go back outside. I follow the wall and hide in the shadow of the building. I watch a man leave through the same door I did, but continue straight onto the gravel. He has a flashlight in his hands but isn’t using it for some reason. I watch him turn left into a single-person apartment. I move in the opposite direction. I stumble upon a sidewalk sandwich board leaning up against one of the buildings. It’s got some drawings of pasta bowls on it. It leans on the side of the building under an awning and out of view. It’s a cluttered corner that will serve as my bed for the rest of the night. I pick up the board and unfold it so it stands on its own. I move behind it and look at the grounds. I see the laundry room and the campground office. As soon as they open up, I’m checking in, getting a shower, and sleeping. I can’t do this much longer.</p>

<p>–:– 
With my knees to my chest and my right shoulder against the wall of the restaurant, I close my eyes and after some time, feel my muscles lose all intention. My fingers slip and then unlock. Finally my left arm hits the sign and lands on the ground with a painfully loud thud. I tighten up again, bringing my legs back in to make sure I am as unnoticeable as possible from someone else’s perspective. The security guard’s lit flashlight passes over my corner twice. I’m not far at all from the laundromat, and therefore from his office. He must pass me in order to get to the door we shared quite some time ago. I pass through the night in a mix of psychosis and anxiety about my secrecy. I realize that if I stay here much longer than first light, I could easily be found out. I remain still, with eyes closed, not asleep, conscious and making decisions about my body position and about the dreams in my head. In and out, I can’t enjoy sleep.</p>

<p>Time slowly passes.</p>

<p>–:– 
I first hear birds chirping in my head. They pan from my left ear, to both ears, then to the right ear, but not wholly to the right because my head is resting on the brick wall. The insides of my eyelids are a shaded pale purple. I open them and see the first light of morning. The birds are real and the sky has color again. I leave the grounds and find a bus stop because the offices don’t open until 10:00. It’s 5:00. I’m not getting anymore sleep tonight and I’ve got Mass to get to at St. Peter’s. Exhausted, I make several awfully bad choices with regards to bus numbers and end up far away from the Vatican.</p>

<p>I get off the bus about a mile up the river from my destination. With sunlight beaming down on me, I walk up toward the magnificent dome. Dark has truly made way for the most beautiful morning. My joints are aching and my muscles are relaxing, but my mind is moving much quicker than before. I notice a difference in the way I view both the streets and other people. I am different after last night. I know what it’s like to walk more than a mile in someone else’s shoes.</p>

<p>I continue, looking up every now and then to acknowledge the morning jogger and to refocus on the growing Vatican dome.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>It’s late and I watch the sun set with disappointment. I still don’t know where I’m staying tonight. I may bring myself to find a place, but I’ll probably convince myself otherwise. I am pushed onto the streets against my will just like I thought and dreamed. I face the west. Despite what I want, ambition keeps me to my word. “It’s one night,” I tell myself. It’s one out of a thousand that the homeless face. My internal conflict switches sides quickly and I lean back and forth. The eight euros that I spent on my hostel for the night weigh heavily on my mind. It’s cold, it’s not safe, and someone could steal my backpack if I fall asleep. If my phone and wallet were taken from me, I would feel it in the pit of my stomach for months to come. The money and documentation that were so difficult to obtain would be a nightmare to replace. I realize that I am risking more than just my possessions.</p>

<p><br />
My heart is torn between two individuals. Half belongs to the person that I want to be, while the other to the person that I am now. I give reason after reason to escape this self-deprecating inner conversation. Every time, however, my conscience comes full circle and keeps me involved. This vicious cycle resorts back to one idea consistently: “I am not intimidated by the devil.” I battle between the choice of bed or concrete. My hip flexor, my blisters, and my knee all twinge painfully. I lean on the short stone wall that overlooks the river and hang my head low between my shoulders.</p>

<p><br />
While I do not know what will happen, I choose to face the streets tonight. It surely goes against the advice of all others back home and their response may be resoundingly negative when they find out. Tomorrow my decision will be justified. I will have perspective and experience, which I value beyond the threat to my safety. I didn’t think I would make it to Italy, yet here I am alive and well. Here begins life like it won’t last.<br />
I step in for dinner at a humble cafe. The gelato there is old and served after being frozen. The sandwiches look decent but aren’t substantial. Since this small place doesn’t have enough seating for the few people inside, I offer the open table beside me to the couple who followed me in. They invite me to join them and so I do. We don’t talk at first because they speak Dutch. They talk back and forth as I listen quietly. She has some pink gelato and he drinks a beer. I chuckle at his jokes and after a game of charades, find out that they are leisurely travelling now that their kids are at university. They learn that I’m studying in Marseille. She calls for their check, and they get up to leave. We say our goodbyes and I stay to pass time.</p>

<p><br />
After wearing off my welcome, I get up to pay the man behind the glass counter. Two men (one in the front of the cafe and the other now in the back) throw some Italian across the restaurant and inform me that the couple I sat with paid for my dinner. I welcome back the 8 euros spent on the empty hostel bed I reserved.<br />
<br />
21:01<br />
I’m thinking about tomorrow morning. The only thing I have on my schedule is Mass at 8:30 at St. Peter’s Basilica. There are 12 hours until then. I’ve only just begun this long night and my eyes are aching already. I imagine the sunrise in my head, which pains my irises as if I’m actually looking at it. I get on a bus, mostly to rest. I woke up this morning at 8:00 and rushed out of the door to the airport. That was 12 hours ago. I realize that I am in the dead center, exactly where I hate to be. I cringe at the thought as it begins to lose balance. The driver mechanically steps on the gas long before I’ve made my way to the back. I catch myself and grab the dirty handrail hanging down from the roof of the bus. I sit down, noticing my reflection and the shallow bags beneath my eyes. I look at my palms. Using the public transportation here is giving me warts on my hands. It’s been 10 years since my fingers had warts on them and three are back since I’ve been in Europe.</p>

<p><br />
I underestimated how much happened in public at night. As if it doesn’t exist and as if nothing happens just because I’ve never spent a night alone in the dark. I realize how far-stretched, long, and sleepless tonight will be. I’m sitting on edge, under fluorescent lights, as the night only just begins. All I can think to do is ride the bus for as long as I can.</p>

<p><br />
The bus gets crowded. I stand for a while listening to conversations in languages I don’t speak. I am desperately far from being able to experience life through their eyes as I am outside of comprehension. Eavesdropping is a luxury I’ve long been stripped of. Although I’m around others, I can’t relate to anything that’s being said: the drama, the plans, and the nicely dressed people heading to a table set for two. I’m not a part of their world. I’m an American — a sad, barely bilingual American who is pretty far out of water, trying to take in air that’s not made for him. The bus breathes freely, however. I can feel the city’s life as the crowds fluctuate in and out. It all looks so different now, like they have privilege which magnifies my lack thereof. I feel lessened in the presence of others, as if I could stick out more than I already do.</p>

<p><br />
These damned curvy yellow plastic bus seats along with the cold hard interior of the bus become more and more uncomfortable over time. The form-fitting spine of the chair supports the human body at first, but after a while feels painfully unnatural. This environment was made with the worst intentions. It’s as if it was made to be as uncomfortable as possible so people like me wouldn’t want to stay. Nonetheless, I stay as long as I can because it’s a safe haven. I ride the bus until the end of its line and am kicked off in a foreign language. It’s unexpectedly over.</p>

<p><br />
I don’t have the words to explain desertion. I don’t know how to punctuate the gross abandonment I felt in the pit of my stomach when the engine of the bus cut. As if the fuel for the bus was the same that kept me running, I feel the engine die in the center of my chest. I descend into the cosmic black parking lot. There are two cars at the edge of the light and no other people around once the bus driver leaves. The stars above don’t mean anything and the lights of the apartment buildings shut me out. Scattered puddles mirror the speckled lights above them and ambiguate the line between the tar lot and the blacker night sky. It’s just past midnight and the mystery of everything, all at once, is multiplied by the lack of light and direction. I feel the wind and cold easily move through my jean jacket and t–shirt. The written words on signs and maps don’t make sense and I don’t know where to begin in piecing them together. My body, my head, and my heart have lost any sense of navigation here at some suburban outpost.</p>

<p><br />
I tell myself my name is no longer my own and that I am someone new in order to cope. I’ll do anything to disconnect myself from who I am as a protective measure (whether this is protection from myself or from someone else, I don’t know). I know, however, that I don’t want this experience attached to my name anymore because it’s turning out to be much more intimidating that I originally imagined. I don’t want to make a decision or have to pick between right or left when both equally lead to shit. I don’t want to choose, lose, and then regret not taking the other, as if it could have been better. I am no one trying to outwit reflections of myself in puddles. I try to make it to sunrise because it’s the only thing I have to look forward to. Because suddenly my home is in church and I have no other seat reserved for me. That is the only thing I have to look forward to-take me off the streets and into those walls.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I walk away from homes because I fear the moment a face turns the corner in front of me. I replay a moment like this several times to desensitize myself from the fear that would course through my body. I tell myself that when it happens I need to keep my mouth closed and my eyes focused, and carefully calculate how my limbs will react. I decide between fight or flight in preparation. Apartments spread out into windy neighborhoods and my mind meticulously keeps track of everything that I see. Graffiti and grass spew through cracks in the concrete. I’m led by the road into Roman suburbia, with my hands shoved into my pockets to keep them from the cold. I clench them tightly into fists and look up at a wide street sign. Its white background bends iridescent reflections of scattered lights.</p>

<p><br />
My eyes lie. They speak of focus and purpose, both of which I am without. In a hyperactive state, my senses do all they can to protect me from threats. I can see behind myself when I hear engine noises and can feel lights press against my neck. I piece these hints together in my head and expect them as they approach. The lights of this on-coming car inspect me, along with the driver behind them. I clench my jaw tightly and sharpen my eyes. I fib my way through with my body language and the car moves past me, sending a shiver down my spine that causes me to stand straighter than before. I walk slower now, although I try to keep my pace up to maintain body heat. The buildings space out further and further until I see the end of the street lights quickly approaching. I stare once more into starry sky and empty earth. I continue forward, leaving the world in which I once dwelt.</p>

<p><br />
I am no longer affixed by the time or standards that measure days. I am now a part of a mindset without metrics, because I am only concerned for myself and for my protection. People have become opponents. I move out of time and into the spaciousness of experiences.</p>

<p><br />
A black car approaches me slowly, much slower than the others before. It barely rolls at my walking speed. Suddenly it is beside me. The driver even made the effort to blacken the rims and darken the windows. The light of pale faces is barely visible through the window. I look and they look too. I stare into the window. With my eyes strong and my jaw tight, I communicate one message to the man as he looks back: “I am not scared of you.” I speak the truth. He passes me, pulls a U–turn back the other way, and accelerates away from me. I don’t know where he’s decided to go or if I’ll see his return. I don’t want to find out. I pull the straps on my backpack and quickly cross the street over to the sidewalk. I cross through several alleys and resolve to find a spot to lie low for a while. Here, where nature begins to mix with residence, I come across an alcove made of hedges and neatly-kept trees between the street and someone’s home. I cross through into the backyard and, after the branches return to their stillness and the last of the leaves hit the ground, it is finally quiet again. My breathing slows down.</p>

<p><br />
The windows of the house are dim. I am thankful to have come across this backyard just as the houses began to get more sparse down. God, I am glad there are no dogs here because I hear them echoing across the night above me. There’s a parked car on the stone driveway that winds up a curving hill. It goes around the side of the house and away from the street that I came from. It’s perfect, but in a perfect world I wouldn’t be doing this. A small, single-wide gate crosses just in front of me with a sign hanging from it. I can’t read what it says, however. I step closer to the sign, brushing past overgrown hedgerows. There’s an icon of a video surveillance system that gets a quick reaction out of me as soon as I figure it out. I back up recklessly, making a senseless ruckus. I ask myself where it is that I plan to go. I’m not leaving. If they are home, they’re asleep; if they aren’t home, they will watch the video in the morning and I’ll be gone. Nothing’s happened so far, no alarms have gone off, and I’m not going to let a sign keep me from the best spot I’ve found all night, yet another makeshift safe haven. I’ve found my way to my room.</p>

<p><br />
It’s a narrow space, a kind of hall between street and yard. The worn and used path is faded to dirt. I get down on one knee, one palm on the ground and the other pressing on my knee. I pause to think about what I’m doing.</p>

<p><br />
I continue down to the ground. I am still wearing my backpack as I move from one knee, to sitting, to laying on my side. At first, the relief to my body is pleasant. My head rests on the back of my hands and my nose is parallel with the ground. I can see my breath mix with the dirt that it moves. The smell of dirt reminds me of when my brothers and I were younger and of how we spent long sunny days building forts in the woods. We were a team of four along with some friends, setting out with a mission to build something. We would divide tasks, collect materials, and build based on talent. We knew our positions— although the youngest brother never seemed happy with his. Someone had to do those jobs and he got over it eventually. Maybe not that day, but after sleeping it over in the night, his anger was forgotten. Time passes in remembering.</p>

<p><br />
The tip of my nose is getting cold. I breathe out of my mouth, into my palms cupped over my face. My left side chills against the ground. Comfortable becomes cold and colder. Minutes seem stuck in time. I shiver with the seconds. My arms are crossed and my jean jacket is buttoned up tight against my gut. The top button at the collar is open so that I can tuck my nose inside and trap heat. My muscles tighten, my legs are crookedly bent, and my feet writhe in pain.</p>

<p><br />
Time isn’t passing fast enough, so I close my eyes and listen. I see the cars drive by in my head once more. I feel their headlights through my skin. They speed past me as I lay on the ground in the dirt in the middle of the night.</p>

<p><br />
A twig cracks and frightens my eyes open. I didn’t have a choice whether or not to keep them closed. I lay still while my eyes dart quickly, looking for reason. They find nothing, and slowly and suspiciously close again. Just as my eyelashes meet in the middle, a painful probing light catches them and pulls them back. Every detail, every color, every overexposed leaf, shines in brightness. They are unnatural, unreal, and all too real at the same time. Every fold in my clothes is deepened in shadow and colored in full. I look toward the light as a car pulls into the driveway straight towards me. It’s 10 meters away and moving in my direction. I throw my head back and hide my face, trying to look like anything but a person sleeping in a corner of their yard. I tuck my feet into brush and get as still as I can. The car comes closer and the engine gets louder. The face I pictured the car having towers over me. I lie like a fool, but it sees straight through me. The shape of the car grows in ferocity and settles just past my gate to the house. The engine sputters. The two in the car step down onto the gravel and speak a language I wish I knew. They walk slowly as they make way from the car to the house. Clearer and clearer, as if they are getting closer, I can hear the thick stones being kicked around one by one. There are no voices, but the sound of feet moving. And then nothing. I think I am alone again.</p>

<p><br />
Time passes. I am emotionally exhausted. What seemed like a long time has only been a couple of hours. The closest thing I’ll get to sleep tonight is a sort of mix between consciousness and daze, through which I blankly lay. My mind can’t choose between one or the other, so I remain in sheer pain. My whole body shakes uncontrollably. No bigger blanket, no extra jacket, nothing else but to deal with it. The pain grows incrementally over time, until I give up. I angrily get to my feet and leave the area without looking back. With more aggression than necessary, I hit the dirt and leaves from my clothes as I walk away. I don’t know where I’m going.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I continue on, walking past the last house. I turn onto the highway leading out of the city. Morning dew condenses as I walk through the tall uncut grasses in the middle of the median. While my feet are getting soaked, I find some happiness in witnessing the formation of morning dew. I shiver and my teeth chatter. A car approaches me from behind and sounds its horn until it passes me. No doubt, the driver was trying to warn me of the dangers of walking on the highway. I see a sign for a campground and decide to make my way there. I follow the arrows. I cross the empty three–lane street and climb out of the highway, through sobbing grasses and up a steep dirt footpath. I head towards the front entrance of the camping complex and find the community washhouse. Its warm light spills out of the open doors. I pick up my pace, looking out for security, or for any sign of life. I’m not sure if this is a reasonable time to be out. I don’t belong here. I’m not paying for campsite privileges, but I’ve forgotten that they don’t know that.</p>

<p><br />
I quietly enter the men’s side of the washhouse and scan the building for movement. I detect none, but my footsteps echo. I want so badly to sit beneath hot water for the rest of the night but I can’t. Finding a towel, making noises, and risking blatant detachment from my belongings would make the rest of the night far more difficult than necessary. I resort to warming my body with hot water on my face and hands, then leave after using the bathroom. I hope to find some place to stay nearby to claim for the remaining hours, but I don’t see any in sight. I explore the grounds and find individual apartment buildings. I see tents, some RVs, and plenty of small European cars clustered in a distant parking lot. It’s dark and I’m not in the state of mind to build a proper mental map of this place. I am powered by intuition, looking for any place that might serve as protection. I think I’ve found what I’m looking for when I open the door of the laundry room. None of the machines are running, but it’s warm and somehow noisy. I follow the walls searching for a place to lodge myself for a few hours, but find none. I circle the room twice and notice that there’s a large frosted window and door in the room leading to an office. It’s the ground’s security office. A still blue light from a computer is suddenly blocked by a blurry body moving in the direction of the door. I leave as quickly and quietly as I can.<br />
I leave the room and go back outside. I follow the wall and hide in the shadow of the building. I watch a man leave through the same door I did, but continue straight onto the gravel. He has a flashlight in his hands but isn’t using it for some reason. I watch him turn left into a single-person apartment. I move in the opposite direction. I stumble upon a sidewalk sandwich board leaning up against one of the buildings. It’s got some drawings of pasta bowls on it. It leans on the side of the building under an awning and out of view. It’s a cluttered corner that will serve as my bed for the rest of the night. I pick up the board and unfold it so it stands on its own. I move behind it and look at the grounds. I see the laundry room and the campground office. As soon as they open up, I’m checking in, getting a shower, and sleeping. I can’t do this much longer.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
With my knees to my chest and my right shoulder against the wall of the restaurant, I close my eyes and after some time, feel my muscles lose all intention. My fingers slip and then unlock. Finally my left arm hits the sign and lands on the ground with a painfully loud thud. I tighten up again, bringing my legs back in to make sure I am as unnoticeable as possible from someone else’s perspective. The security guard’s lit flashlight passes over my corner twice. I’m not far at all from the laundromat, and therefore from his office. He must pass me in order to get to the door we shared quite some time ago. I pass through the night in a mix of psychosis and anxiety about my secrecy. I realize that if I stay here much longer than first light, I could easily be found out. I remain still, with eyes closed, not asleep, conscious and making decisions about my body position and about the dreams in my head. In and out, I can’t enjoy sleep.</p>

<p>Time slowly passes.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I first hear birds chirping in my head. They pan from my left ear, to both ears, then to the right ear, but not wholly to the right because my head is resting on the brick wall. The insides of my eyelids are a shaded pale purple. I open them and see the first light of morning. The birds are real and the sky has color again. I leave the grounds and find a bus stop because the offices don’t open until 10:00. It’s 5:00. I’m not getting anymore sleep tonight and I’ve got Mass to get to at St. Peter’s. Exhausted, I make several awfully bad choices with regards to bus numbers and end up far away from the Vatican.</p>

<p><br />
I get off the bus about a mile up the river from my destination. With sunlight beaming down on me, I walk up toward the magnificent dome. Dark has truly made way for the most beautiful morning. My joints are aching and my muscles are relaxing, but my mind is moving much quicker than before. I notice a difference in the way I view both the streets and other people. I am different after last night. I know what it’s like to walk more than a mile in someone else’s shoes.</p>

<p><br />
I continue, looking up every now and then to acknowledge the morning jogger and to refocus on the growing Vatican dome.</p>

            </div>   
            <div class="content_div"><p>Five in the morning came with biting vengeance. It came quickly, with cloudy wet weather and cold winds. I shove my feet into my shoes and begin making my way to St. Peter’s Square. There’s already a group of seven at the bus stop, causing me to question if I woke up too late. The bus takes a long time to show up. When it finally arrives, the group comes down from their tiptoes, waiting for the bus to round the corner. We board the bus heading towards the Vatican in silence and excitement. There’s a group of five nuns next to me who are calmly and maturely smiling at one another. It’s early in the morning and I’m not sure what my body language is saying, but I’m probably not looking nearly as cool as these sisters are. It’s like Christmas morning for Catholics. We get off the bus and I immediately lengthen my stride to pass the group. Forget about the nuns; they’re eating my dust. I’m just trying to catch a good glimpse of the Pope.</p>

<p>The line, or rather the hoard, is bigger than I expected: 700 at least already. Suited men in cars honk their horns at the people blocking the streets leading to the gates of St. Peter’s Square. After I navigate through traffic and the surrounding people, I make the move I suspect others want to make. I’m not waiting at the back of the line. I pass the crowd and begin looking for anything or anyone. I am crooking my neck and picking out faces in the crowd. I’m posturing my body as if I’m looking for someone. Funnily enough, I found exactly who I was looking for. As if it makes any logical sense for me to find anyone from my old world, I find Drew, a perfectly familiar face that stands out. He’s from my university in Virginia. Drew stands on the edge of the crowd, dressed like an angel.</p>

<p>I greet Drew in loud American fashion and with overt excitement, possibly to validate my rudeness to the people I cut in front of to get here. He introduces me to his girlfriend and traveling partner. We also meet two other students from the U.S. studying in Rome thanks to our loud greeting. People are now beginning to pour into the line. It doubles, triples, and soon I can’t see its end. The line goes down the street across one of the city’s piazzas, which are also predictably packed with people spilling into the streets.</p>

<p>At 6:00, the floodgates open. The dreaded rain starts pouring while the metal detectors are activated. I don’t know how to explain how happy I was to be pushed around in this crowd of Catholics. They’ve got some fight in them. I knew it wasn’t going to be a stroll down the private school halls, but this energy was tremendous. There was a sudden two-meter rush until the crowd met at a bottleneck. Then there was even more pressure once those in the back heard that the line was moving. Glad you’re awake now, people. You’re celebrating Easter with the Pope today.</p>

<p>I am proud of the Church. I always have been. However, I feel differently today because I see the unholy and sloppy side of Catholics on full display as we all try to get inside the Square. People aren’t perfect, and I hate being in groups of friends who pretend like they are. Here, on Easter morning, there’s no hiding these beautifully rude and impatient pilgrims trying to make the most of the day.
We finally move through the detectors. Before I manage to get my belt back on, we somehow find seats only seven rows away from the altar. What did I do to deserve this? Never in my life did I imagine You would keep me so close. Never did I think I had the relevance to keep Your company like this. I am here in a space built for 80,000 people. There are only seven in front of me. Looking over their heads, I see only stone separating You and I. In front of me are the choir, the priests, and the nuns, who I guess had reserved seating and therefore had no need to rush off the bus. I’m closer than I ever dared to imagine. The Basilica faces me and I face it. The twelve Disciples and Jesus are looming above me, each sculpted out of stone and staring over the crowd below. I’ve never seen anything so ominously beautiful. Architecture is powerful. I’m standing at the base of these massive statues and sculpted white stones which all build up a facade that reaches far over my head. I shrink in comparison. I know that this one massive Church, surrounded by dark clouds and heavy rain, has stood firm through centuries. This Square, reverberating with the sounds of organs and song, will continue to go down in history. I am in awe knowing that I am backed by a beauty as great as this. I have no more words. 
As the rain falls, the temperature drops with it. We sit soaked to bone while minutes creep by in utter awfulness. Some people leave but most don’t. Some don’t understand why they are there, and some don’t feel as if they belong, yet the misery of this morning transcends worldly understanding. An hour ticked by, leaving us to endure the next. I dwell in the cold as I did during the measureless hours of my first night here in Rome. I am thankful for those hardships now and am more grateful for what I don’t understand. I’m also learning to be thankful for what I can’t control. I’m thankful that there was no rain during that night in the streets and for finding Drew when he could have been anywhere else in the world. I am thankful for the chance meetings throughout my time in Rome and for the many people I’ve met far from home. No matter whether it is framed as introversion or extroversion, we’re more dependent than I like to think.</p>

<p>An hour ticks by and we face the next.</p>

My visions of blood and pain, of sacrifice and courage, may not allude to my future in the way that I believe they do. The thought of death is so real that it is avoided. Who thinks about dying? Who thinks about how they will die? When you picture the face of death, can it look so real that it moves you to tears? Do you see the bloodshot eyes and mournful actions that follow death?</p>

<p>I’ve thought about this at length. Several days ago, I wrote letters for my mother to find in case something happened to me today. Those are words that I never want to read again. I never want her to read them; yet it felt as if I had no other choice but to die for something worthy of the love she’s given me. I would die for her. That’s not easy to say, because I mean it. The love she’s given me is unfailing, whole, and holy. The Savior I seek has been raising me from birth.</p>

<p>I know what it means to sacrifice your life for another, so I would never say this lightly. I know the sickening feeling in my stomach. Like the imminence of death to a poisonous exposure, this feeling courses through my veins. Where can it go that I have not already been? I am, from now on, dying everyday. I will not speak life into death by acknowledging it. Let it be as it is supposed to be. I will live unafraid of the end because the end is infinitely closer to where I now stand. I will run to the future laid before me and to the mile markers I pass. I chase as if there is something or someone to catch up to.</p>

even and opposite consequences 
walking around like some kind of big shot
well let me tell you something when push comes to shove you’re not</p>

<p>feeble, breed not
we’ll take it back in over time 
little, brittle, hollow, and low
let’s see how far these fine fools will go</p>

<p>oh my God, what have I done?
everything I loved, everything I’ve lost</p>

<p>so raise your predecessors from the grave
get tough with even and opposite consequences</p>

<p>I wake from a dream
I see a space between the trees
and the waves crashing down
upon the watercolor sea
and from it rises a part of me
I never wanted to see</p>

<p>there’s a light in the back of this house
and there’s gasoline poured over everything
strike a match and watch them burn</p>

<p>a role adversary happens to be 
what everybody wants to see</p>

<p>I tell myself I won’t let this happen again 
because we are fed line after line, 
being told that these environments 
are not made with malicious intent, 
they don’t want to see you happy, 
they don’t want to see you succeed, 
he counts on you being broken, isolated, and cold, 
that’s the only chance he has to get what he wants</p>
