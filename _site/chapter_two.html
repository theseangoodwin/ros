        <h2>24.&nbsp;A Reflection on Odd Numbers</h2>
        
        <p>
        28 Jul 2020
        
        </p>

        
        
        <p>What is it about the nature of odd or even that influences our minds? I am told to always design in odd numbers. However, we sometimes need elements to stick out, and at other times, we want to blend in, especially now in foreign territory. The holiness of the number seven is so close to the menace of six yet infinitely more superior. We try our entire lives to bridge the gap of one and many can’t. The love of three parts created a single One, to come onto Earth to demystify the path leading from one to the other. Simplicity, I fear, makes things more difficult. Knowing the odds you’re up against reveals the opposition we face. For someone like myself, that opposition often seems too large to overcome.</p>

        <h2>76.&nbsp;A Reflection on Death: Poison I Was Born With</h2>
        
        <p>
        28 Jul 2020
        
        </p>

        
        
        <p>What if in my dreams, my death was only a dream? My visions of blood and pain, of sacrifice and courage, may not allude to my future in the way that I believe they do. The thought of death is so real that it is avoided. Who thinks about dying? Who thinks about how they will die? When you picture the face of death, can it look so real that it moves you to tears? Do you see the bloodshot eyes and mournful actions that follow death?<br />
I’ve thought about this at length. Several days ago, I wrote letters for my mother to find in case something happened to me today. Those are words that I never want to read again. I never want her to read them; yet it felt as if I had no other choice but to die for something worthy of the love she’s given me. I would die for her. That’s not easy to say, because I mean it. The love she’s given me is unfailing, whole, and holy. The Savior I seek has been raising me from birth.<br />
I know what it means to sacrifice your life for another, so I would never say this lightly. I know the sickening feeling in my stomach. Like the imminence of death to a poisonous exposure, this feeling courses through my veins. Where can it go that I have not already been? I am, from now on, dying everyday. I will not speak life into death by acknowledging it. Let it be as it is supposed to be. I will live unafraid of the end because the end is infinitely closer to where I now stand. I will run to the future laid before me and to the mile markers I pass. I chase as if there is something or someone to catch up to.</p>

        <h2>73.&nbsp;Myself, Through The Nerves of Another,  and Hours Without Measure</h2>
        
        <p>
        28 Jul 2020
        
        </p>

        
        
        <p>It’s late and I watch the sun set with disappointment. I still don’t know where I’m staying tonight. I may bring myself to find a place, but I’ll probably convince myself otherwise. I am pushed onto the streets against my will just like I thought and dreamed. I face the west. Despite what I want, ambition keeps me to my word. “It’s one night,” I tell myself. It’s one out of a thousand that the homeless face. My internal conflict switches sides quickly and I lean back and forth. The eight euros that I spent on my hostel for the night weigh heavily on my mind. It’s cold, it’s not safe, and someone could steal my backpack if I fall asleep. If my phone and wallet were taken from me, I would feel it in the pit of my stomach for months to come. The money and documentation that were so difficult to obtain would be a nightmare to replace. I realize that I am risking more than just my possessions.</p>
