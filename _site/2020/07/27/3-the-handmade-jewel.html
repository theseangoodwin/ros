<p>A few days before my departure, I showed my mother the basilica in Marseille. She taught me about relics, which sent me on a seemingly elusive quest for a piece of history. It wasn’t long before history made its way to me.</p>

<p><br />
At this altitude, we are all a little bit closer to heaven. The ones we love and miss are only just outside of this metal tube miraculously soaring through the sky. The stewardess sees me moving my fingers through the rosary hanging around my neck, just like my mother always does before flying. She interrupts and we begin an intermittent 6-hour conversation, the kind that is built bit by bit as she walks around the plane. She spends slightly more time pouring drinks and joking with me than attending to the rest of the passengers.</p>

<p><br />
I notice something very admirable about her. It’s her voice. The way she speaks to others, like the German families returning to Frankfurt from vacation or the businessmen heading abroad for work, is not limited by language. She knows how to relate to each individual and builds rapport that seems effortless, for both her and for whomever she talks with. It’s as if she doesn’t think about it. She laughs with everyone and presents herself in a way that makes it easy to react, even at 4:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><br />
The plane is dark for the final hour of the flight. The plane’s passengers are beginning to arise out of restlessness. The stewardess quickly approaches me from behind and pushes my shoulder from the armrest. “A present for you,” she says, and places a small something in my possession. She makes no eye contact with me, although I was looking for it. She continues down the dim aisle toward the front of the plane, walks past a set of dark blue curtains, and tightly draws them after passing. I am distracted by a sense of secrecy and abnormality about her. In my palm, I find a small circular box that somehow also has corners. I want to use my light to see more clearly, but also don’t want to draw attention to the stewardess if she was in fact trying to be quiet about her present. I pull off the lid, as if it would help me see through the darkness of the cabin. I only see darkness, but the smell that comes from the inside of the box is one from my childhood. It is a spice and sweetness that collects in your throat and lingers there for a while before your body accepts its warmth as something wholly comforting. It is as familiar as walking into an old church parish. The smell is sharp, striking, and I choke a little bit, but it is ultimately beautiful, just like the rosary that lies in the box.</p>

<p><br />
My mind is drawn back to the final hours of my Grandmother’s life. I see her in her hospital bed surrounded by her disunified family. She’s covered in a pale blue loose-knit blanket made by her children, the kind that doesn’t protect you from the cold. I look at my young self sitting hunched over on a bench in the corner of the hospital room. I watch myself look at anything but the bed in the middle of the space and am grateful that I can’t see past the small crowd of people that surround her.</p>

<p><br />
I didn’t see it happen. It doesn’t matter where I am, even if I had the opportunity to see, I wouldn’t have been able to watch her die. My eyes close tightly. M y tears swim The day she died was close to the day I turned thirteen. I didn’t know how to handle the selfish side of me that just wanted a normal birthday. I was too young, too egocentric. I had never dealt with anything like this before, and the &lt;blockquote&gt;ideas I previously held of <span class="blackletter">life</span> and death never focused much on <span class="blackletter">death.</span><a class="interaction-box"></a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p><br />
My innocence and my unfailing optimism left on that day and followed her. I cling to this unfortunate fact as if it is some sort of celestial proof that she and I had a relationship that was unlike those I had with rest of my family — as if it were an alibi justifying my absence from her side. It provided some meager consolation to the boy who wasn’t strong enough to hold back the tears from his eyes. I wish that I said goodbye. I wish I was strong enough to look at her and tell her that I loved her. I was the only one not there. Self-pity, loss, and change: the three threats that convinced my adolescent mind to hide high up in the clouds.</p>

<p><br />
Back in the sky, I decided to use the light above my head to dimly illuminate the contents of the box. The beads are a pale painted red and worn. The wood’s grain, however, is not hidden beneath the paint. The decades coil around a thick metal cross depicting a shepherd who carries a sheep over his shoulders. The smell fills the cabin and I start to notice my neighbors reacting to it. I close the lid, conceal the box in my hands, and turn off the spotlight. It is a beautiful gift – a birthday present. I feel safe and cared for.</p>

<p><br />
My spine shivers from these emotions that I’ve never experienced before. I write to articulate to myself how I feel. I feel here and now the undeniable existence of heaven and its relevance to our lives. I know that my Grandmother is well because the poignant scent of the rosary is the loving kiss she gave me before sending me off alone.</p>

<p><br />
The stewardess emerges back through the curtains, looks into my eyes, and places on my fold-down dinner table a documented relic, a piece of John Paul II’s robe. She walks away and that is the last I see of her.<br />
Her name was Edna.</p>
