<h1>24. A Reflection on Odd Numbers (S 176)</h1>

<p>What is it about the nature of odd or even that influences our minds? I am told to always design in odd numbers. However, we sometimes need elements to stick out, and at other times, we want to blend in, especially now in foreign territory. The holiness of the number seven is so close to the menace of six yet infinitely more superior. We try our entire lives to bridge the gap of one and many can’t. The love of three parts created a single One, to come onto Earth to demystify the path leading from one to the other. Simplicity, I fear, makes things more difficult. Knowing the odds you’re up against reveals the opposition we face. For someone like myself, that opposition often seems too large to overcome.<br />
The difference One makes in the scale of eternity is far greater than I ever imagined. The name makes it accessible. Close enough to achieve, but not quite within reach. I continue with the odds in my favor; I’ll take all the help I can get.</p>
