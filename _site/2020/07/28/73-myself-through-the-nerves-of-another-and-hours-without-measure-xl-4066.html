<h1>Myself, Through The Nerves of Another,  and Hours Without Measure</h1>

<p>
  28 Jul 2020
</p>





<p>It’s late and I watch the sun set with disappointment. I still don’t know where I’m staying tonight. I may bring myself to find a place, but I’ll probably convince myself otherwise. I am pushed onto the streets against my will just like I thought and dreamed. I face the west. Despite what I want, ambition keeps me to my word. “It’s one night,” I tell myself. It’s one out of a thousand that the homeless face. My internal conflict switches sides quickly and I lean back and forth. The eight euros that I spent on my hostel for the night weigh heavily on my mind. It’s cold, it’s not safe, and someone could steal my backpack if I fall asleep. If my phone and wallet were taken from me, I would feel it in the pit of my stomach for months to come. The money and documentation that were so difficult to obtain would be a nightmare to replace. I realize that I am risking more than just my possessions.</p>

<p><br />
My heart is torn between two individuals. Half belongs to the person that I want to be, while the other to the person that I am now. I give reason after reason to escape this self-deprecating inner conversation. Every time, however, my conscience comes full circle and keeps me involved. This vicious cycle resorts back to one idea consistently: “I am not intimidated by the devil.” I battle between the choice of bed or concrete. My hip flexor, my blisters, and my knee all twinge painfully. I lean on the short stone wall that overlooks the river and hang my head low between my shoulders.</p>

<p><br />
While I do not know what will happen, I choose to face the streets tonight. It surely goes against the advice of all others back home and their response may be resoundingly negative when they find out. Tomorrow my decision will be justified. I will have perspective and experience, which I value beyond the threat to my safety. I didn’t think I would make it to Italy, yet here I am alive and well. Here begins life like it won’t last.<br />
I step in for dinner at a humble cafe. The gelato there is old and served after being frozen. The sandwiches look decent but aren’t substantial. Since this small place doesn’t have enough seating for the few people inside, I offer the open table beside me to the couple who followed me in. They invite me to join them and so I do. We don’t talk at first because they speak Dutch. They talk back and forth as I listen quietly. She has some pink gelato and he drinks a beer. I chuckle at his jokes and after a game of charades, find out that they are leisurely travelling now that their kids are at university. They learn that I’m studying in Marseille. She calls for their check, and they get up to leave. We say our goodbyes and I stay to pass time.</p>

<p><br />
After wearing off my welcome, I get up to pay the man behind the glass counter. Two men (one in the front of the cafe and the other now in the back) throw some Italian across the restaurant and inform me that the couple I sat with paid for my dinner. I welcome back the 8 euros spent on the empty hostel bed I reserved.<br />
<br />
21:01<br />
I’m thinking about tomorrow morning. The only thing I have on my schedule is Mass at 8:30 at St. Peter’s Basilica. There are 12 hours until then. I’ve only just begun this long night and my eyes are aching already. I imagine the sunrise in my head, which pains my irises as if I’m actually looking at it. I get on a bus, mostly to rest. I woke up this morning at 8:00 and rushed out of the door to the airport. That was 12 hours ago. I realize that I am in the dead center, exactly where I hate to be. I cringe at the thought as it begins to lose balance. The driver mechanically steps on the gas long before I’ve made my way to the back. I catch myself and grab the dirty handrail hanging down from the roof of the bus. I sit down, noticing my reflection and the shallow bags beneath my eyes. I look at my palms. Using the public transportation here is giving me warts on my hands. It’s been 10 years since my fingers had warts on them and three are back since I’ve been in Europe.</p>

<p><br />
I underestimated how much happened in public at night. As if it doesn’t exist and as if nothing happens just because I’ve never spent a night alone in the dark. I realize how far-stretched, long, and sleepless tonight will be. I’m sitting on edge, under fluorescent lights, as the night only just begins. All I can think to do is ride the bus for as long as I can.</p>

<p><br />
The bus gets crowded. I stand for a while listening to conversations in languages I don’t speak. I am desperately far from being able to experience life through their eyes as I am outside of comprehension. Eavesdropping is a luxury I’ve long been stripped of. Although I’m around others, I can’t relate to anything that’s being said: the drama, the plans, and the nicely dressed people heading to a table set for two. I’m not a part of their world. I’m an American — a sad, barely bilingual American who is pretty far out of water, trying to take in air that’s not made for him. The bus breathes freely, however. I can feel the city’s life as the crowds fluctuate in and out. It all looks so different now, like they have privilege which magnifies my lack thereof. I feel lessened in the presence of others, as if I could stick out more than I already do.</p>

<p><br />
These damned curvy yellow plastic bus seats along with the cold hard interior of the bus become more and more uncomfortable over time. The form-fitting spine of the chair supports the human body at first, but after a while feels painfully unnatural. This environment was made with the worst intentions. It’s as if it was made to be as uncomfortable as possible so people like me wouldn’t want to stay. Nonetheless, I stay as long as I can because it’s a safe haven. I ride the bus until the end of its line and am kicked off in a foreign language. It’s unexpectedly over.</p>

<p><br />
I don’t have the words to explain desertion. I don’t know how to punctuate the gross abandonment I felt in the pit of my stomach when the engine of the bus cut. As if the fuel for the bus was the same that kept me running, I feel the engine die in the center of my chest. I descend into the cosmic black parking lot. There are two cars at the edge of the light and no other people around once the bus driver leaves. The stars above don’t mean anything and the lights of the apartment buildings shut me out. Scattered puddles mirror the speckled lights above them and ambiguate the line between the tar lot and the blacker night sky. It’s just past midnight and the mystery of everything, all at once, is multiplied by the lack of light and direction. I feel the wind and cold easily move through my jean jacket and t–shirt. The written words on signs and maps don’t make sense and I don’t know where to begin in piecing them together. My body, my head, and my heart have lost any sense of navigation here at some suburban outpost.</p>

<p><br />
I tell myself my name is no longer my own and that I am someone new in order to cope. I’ll do anything to disconnect myself from who I am as a protective measure (whether this is protection from myself or from someone else, I don’t know). I know, however, that I don’t want this experience attached to my name anymore because it’s turning out to be much more intimidating that I originally imagined. I don’t want to make a decision or have to pick between right or left when both equally lead to shit. I don’t want to choose, lose, and then regret not taking the other, as if it could have been better. I am no one trying to outwit reflections of myself in puddles. I try to make it to sunrise because it’s the only thing I have to look forward to. Because suddenly my home is in church and I have no other seat reserved for me. That is the only thing I have to look forward to-take me off the streets and into those walls.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I walk away from homes because I fear the moment a face turns the corner in front of me. I replay a moment like this several times to desensitize myself from the fear that would course through my body. I tell myself that when it happens I need to keep my mouth closed and my eyes focused, and carefully calculate how my limbs will react. I decide between fight or flight in preparation. Apartments spread out into windy neighborhoods and my mind meticulously keeps track of everything that I see. Graffiti and grass spew through cracks in the concrete. I’m led by the road into Roman suburbia, with my hands shoved into my pockets to keep them from the cold. I clench them tightly into fists and look up at a wide street sign. Its white background bends iridescent reflections of scattered lights.</p>

<p><br />
My eyes lie. They speak of focus and purpose, both of which I am without. In a hyperactive state, my senses do all they can to protect me from threats. I can see behind myself when I hear engine noises and can feel lights press against my neck. I piece these hints together in my head and expect them as they approach. The lights of this on-coming car inspect me, along with the driver behind them. I clench my jaw tightly and sharpen my eyes. I fib my way through with my body language and the car moves past me, sending a shiver down my spine that causes me to stand straighter than before. I walk slower now, although I try to keep my pace up to maintain body heat. The buildings space out further and further until I see the end of the street lights quickly approaching. I stare once more into starry sky and empty earth. I continue forward, leaving the world in which I once dwelt.</p>

<p><br />
I am no longer affixed by the time or standards that measure days. I am now a part of a mindset without metrics, because I am only concerned for myself and for my protection. People have become opponents. I move out of time and into the spaciousness of experiences.</p>

<p><br />
A black car approaches me slowly, much slower than the others before. It barely rolls at my walking speed. Suddenly it is beside me. The driver even made the effort to blacken the rims and darken the windows. The light of pale faces is barely visible through the window. I look and they look too. I stare into the window. With my eyes strong and my jaw tight, I communicate one message to the man as he looks back: “I am not scared of you.” I speak the truth. He passes me, pulls a U–turn back the other way, and accelerates away from me. I don’t know where he’s decided to go or if I’ll see his return. I don’t want to find out. I pull the straps on my backpack and quickly cross the street over to the sidewalk. I cross through several alleys and resolve to find a spot to lie low for a while. Here, where nature begins to mix with residence, I come across an alcove made of hedges and neatly-kept trees between the street and someone’s home. I cross through into the backyard and, after the branches return to their stillness and the last of the leaves hit the ground, it is finally quiet again. My breathing slows down.</p>

<p><br />
The windows of the house are dim. I am thankful to have come across this backyard just as the houses began to get more sparse down. God, I am glad there are no dogs here because I hear them echoing across the night above me. There’s a parked car on the stone driveway that winds up a curving hill. It goes around the side of the house and away from the street that I came from. It’s perfect, but in a perfect world I wouldn’t be doing this. A small, single-wide gate crosses just in front of me with a sign hanging from it. I can’t read what it says, however. I step closer to the sign, brushing past overgrown hedgerows. There’s an icon of a video surveillance system that gets a quick reaction out of me as soon as I figure it out. I back up recklessly, making a senseless ruckus. I ask myself where it is that I plan to go. I’m not leaving. If they are home, they’re asleep; if they aren’t home, they will watch the video in the morning and I’ll be gone. Nothing’s happened so far, no alarms have gone off, and I’m not going to let a sign keep me from the best spot I’ve found all night, yet another makeshift safe haven. I’ve found my way to my room.</p>

<p><br />
It’s a narrow space, a kind of hall between street and yard. The worn and used path is faded to dirt. I get down on one knee, one palm on the ground and the other pressing on my knee. I pause to think about what I’m doing.</p>

<p><br />
I continue down to the ground. I am still wearing my backpack as I move from one knee, to sitting, to laying on my side. At first, the relief to my body is pleasant. My head rests on the back of my hands and my nose is parallel with the ground. I can see my breath mix with the dirt that it moves. The smell of dirt reminds me of when my brothers and I were younger and of how we spent long sunny days building forts in the woods. We were a team of four along with some friends, setting out with a mission to build something. We would divide tasks, collect materials, and build based on talent. We knew our positions— although the youngest brother never seemed happy with his. Someone had to do those jobs and he got over it eventually. Maybe not that day, but after sleeping it over in the night, his anger was forgotten. Time passes in remembering.</p>

<p><br />
The tip of my nose is getting cold. I breathe out of my mouth, into my palms cupped over my face. My left side chills against the ground. Comfortable becomes cold and colder. Minutes seem stuck in time. I shiver with the seconds. My arms are crossed and my jean jacket is buttoned up tight against my gut. The top button at the collar is open so that I can tuck my nose inside and trap heat. My muscles tighten, my legs are crookedly bent, and my feet writhe in pain.</p>

<p><br />
Time isn’t passing fast enough, so I close my eyes and listen. I see the cars drive by in my head once more. I feel their headlights through my skin. They speed past me as I lay on the ground in the dirt in the middle of the night.</p>

<p><br />
A twig cracks and frightens my eyes open. I didn’t have a choice whether or not to keep them closed. I lay still while my eyes dart quickly, looking for reason. They find nothing, and slowly and suspiciously close again. Just as my eyelashes meet in the middle, a painful probing light catches them and pulls them back. Every detail, every color, every overexposed leaf, shines in brightness. They are unnatural, unreal, and all too real at the same time. Every fold in my clothes is deepened in shadow and colored in full. I look toward the light as a car pulls into the driveway straight towards me. It’s 10 meters away and moving in my direction. I throw my head back and hide my face, trying to look like anything but a person sleeping in a corner of their yard. I tuck my feet into brush and get as still as I can. The car comes closer and the engine gets louder. The face I pictured the car having towers over me. I lie like a fool, but it sees straight through me. The shape of the car grows in ferocity and settles just past my gate to the house. The engine sputters. The two in the car step down onto the gravel and speak a language I wish I knew. They walk slowly as they make way from the car to the house. Clearer and clearer, as if they are getting closer, I can hear the thick stones being kicked around one by one. There are no voices, but the sound of feet moving. And then nothing. I think I am alone again.</p>

<p><br />
Time passes. I am emotionally exhausted. What seemed like a long time has only been a couple of hours. The closest thing I’ll get to sleep tonight is a sort of mix between consciousness and daze, through which I blankly lay. My mind can’t choose between one or the other, so I remain in sheer pain. My whole body shakes uncontrollably. No bigger blanket, no extra jacket, nothing else but to deal with it. The pain grows incrementally over time, until I give up. I angrily get to my feet and leave the area without looking back. With more aggression than necessary, I hit the dirt and leaves from my clothes as I walk away. I don’t know where I’m going.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I continue on, walking past the last house. I turn onto the highway leading out of the city. Morning dew condenses as I walk through the tall uncut grasses in the middle of the median. While my feet are getting soaked, I find some happiness in witnessing the formation of morning dew. I shiver and my teeth chatter. A car approaches me from behind and sounds its horn until it passes me. No doubt, the driver was trying to warn me of the dangers of walking on the highway. I see a sign for a campground and decide to make my way there. I follow the arrows. I cross the empty three–lane street and climb out of the highway, through sobbing grasses and up a steep dirt footpath. I head towards the front entrance of the camping complex and find the community washhouse. Its warm light spills out of the open doors. I pick up my pace, looking out for security, or for any sign of life. I’m not sure if this is a reasonable time to be out. I don’t belong here. I’m not paying for campsite privileges, but I’ve forgotten that they don’t know that.</p>

<p><br />
I quietly enter the men’s side of the washhouse and scan the building for movement. I detect none, but my footsteps echo. I want so badly to sit beneath hot water for the rest of the night but I can’t. Finding a towel, making noises, and risking blatant detachment from my belongings would make the rest of the night far more difficult than necessary. I resort to warming my body with hot water on my face and hands, then leave after using the bathroom. I hope to find some place to stay nearby to claim for the remaining hours, but I don’t see any in sight. I explore the grounds and find individual apartment buildings. I see tents, some RVs, and plenty of small European cars clustered in a distant parking lot. It’s dark and I’m not in the state of mind to build a proper mental map of this place. I am powered by intuition, looking for any place that might serve as protection. I think I’ve found what I’m looking for when I open the door of the laundry room. None of the machines are running, but it’s warm and somehow noisy. I follow the walls searching for a place to lodge myself for a few hours, but find none. I circle the room twice and notice that there’s a large frosted window and door in the room leading to an office. It’s the ground’s security office. A still blue light from a computer is suddenly blocked by a blurry body moving in the direction of the door. I leave as quickly and quietly as I can.<br />
I leave the room and go back outside. I follow the wall and hide in the shadow of the building. I watch a man leave through the same door I did, but continue straight onto the gravel. He has a flashlight in his hands but isn’t using it for some reason. I watch him turn left into a single-person apartment. I move in the opposite direction. I stumble upon a sidewalk sandwich board leaning up against one of the buildings. It’s got some drawings of pasta bowls on it. It leans on the side of the building under an awning and out of view. It’s a cluttered corner that will serve as my bed for the rest of the night. I pick up the board and unfold it so it stands on its own. I move behind it and look at the grounds. I see the laundry room and the campground office. As soon as they open up, I’m checking in, getting a shower, and sleeping. I can’t do this much longer.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
With my knees to my chest and my right shoulder against the wall of the restaurant, I close my eyes and after some time, feel my muscles lose all intention. My fingers slip and then unlock. Finally my left arm hits the sign and lands on the ground with a painfully loud thud. I tighten up again, bringing my legs back in to make sure I am as unnoticeable as possible from someone else’s perspective. The security guard’s lit flashlight passes over my corner twice. I’m not far at all from the laundromat, and therefore from his office. He must pass me in order to get to the door we shared quite some time ago. I pass through the night in a mix of psychosis and anxiety about my secrecy. I realize that if I stay here much longer than first light, I could easily be found out. I remain still, with eyes closed, not asleep, conscious and making decisions about my body position and about the dreams in my head. In and out, I can’t enjoy sleep.</p>

<p>Time slowly passes.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I first hear birds chirping in my head. They pan from my left ear, to both ears, then to the right ear, but not wholly to the right because my head is resting on the brick wall. The insides of my eyelids are a shaded pale purple. I open them and see the first light of morning. The birds are real and the sky has color again. I leave the grounds and find a bus stop because the offices don’t open until 10:00. It’s 5:00. I’m not getting anymore sleep tonight and I’ve got Mass to get to at St. Peter’s. Exhausted, I make several awfully bad choices with regards to bus numbers and end up far away from the Vatican.</p>

<p><br />
I get off the bus about a mile up the river from my destination. With sunlight beaming down on me, I walk up toward the magnificent dome. Dark has truly made way for the most beautiful morning. My joints are aching and my muscles are relaxing, but my mind is moving much quicker than before. I notice a difference in the way I view both the streets and other people. I am different after last night. I know what it’s like to walk more than a mile in someone else’s shoes.</p>

<p><br />
I continue, looking up every now and then to acknowledge the morning jogger and to refocus on the growing Vatican dome.</p>
