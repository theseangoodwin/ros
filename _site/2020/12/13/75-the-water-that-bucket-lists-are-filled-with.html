<h1>75. The Water That Bucket Lists  Are Filled With</h1>

<p>
  13 Dec 2020
</p>




<p>Five in the morning came with biting vengeance. It came quickly, with cloudy wet weather and cold winds. I shove my feet into my shoes and begin making my way to St. Peter’s Square. There’s already a group of seven at the bus stop, causing me to question if I woke up too late. The bus takes a long time to show up. When it finally arrives, the group comes down from their tiptoes, waiting for the bus to round the corner. We board the bus heading towards the Vatican in silence and excitement. There’s a group of five nuns next to me who are calmly and maturely smiling at one another. It’s early in the morning and I’m not sure what my body language is saying, but I’m probably not looking nearly as cool as these sisters are. It’s like Christmas morning for Catholics. We get off the bus and I immediately lengthen my stride to pass the group. Forget about the nuns; they’re eating my dust. I’m just trying to catch a good glimpse of the Pope.</p>

<p>The line, or rather the hoard, is bigger than I expected: 700 at least already. Suited men in cars honk their horns at the people blocking the streets leading to the gates of St. Peter’s Square. After I navigate through traffic and the surrounding people, I make the move I suspect others want to make. I’m not waiting at the back of the line. I pass the crowd and begin looking for anything or anyone. I am crooking my neck and picking out faces in the crowd. I’m posturing my body as if I’m looking for someone. Funnily enough, I found exactly who I was looking for. As if it makes any logical sense for me to find anyone from my old world, I find Drew, a perfectly familiar face that stands out. He’s from my university in Virginia. Drew stands on the edge of the crowd, dressed like an angel.</p>

<p>I greet Drew in loud American fashion and with overt excitement, possibly to validate my rudeness to the people I cut in front of to get here. He introduces me to his girlfriend and traveling partner. We also meet two other students from the U.S. studying in Rome thanks to our loud greeting. People are now beginning to pour into the line. It doubles, triples, and soon I can’t see its end. The line goes down the street across one of the city’s piazzas, which are also predictably packed with people spilling into the streets.</p>

<p>At 6:00, the floodgates open. The dreaded rain starts pouring while the metal detectors are activated. I don’t know how to explain how happy I was to be pushed around in this crowd of Catholics. They’ve got some fight in them. I knew it wasn’t going to be a stroll down the private school halls, but this energy was tremendous. There was a sudden two-meter rush until the crowd met at a bottleneck. Then there was even more pressure once those in the back heard that the line was moving. Glad you’re awake now, people. You’re celebrating Easter with the Pope today.</p>

<p>I am proud of the Church. I always have been. However, I feel differently today because I see the unholy and sloppy side of Catholics on full display as we all try to get inside the Square. People aren’t perfect, and I hate being in groups of friends who pretend like they are. Here, on Easter morning, there’s no hiding these beautifully rude and impatient pilgrims trying to make the most of the day.
We finally move through the detectors. Before I manage to get my belt back on, we somehow find seats only seven rows away from the altar. What did I do to deserve this? Never in my life did I imagine You would keep me so close. Never did I think I had the relevance to keep Your company like this. I am here in a space built for 80,000 people. There are only seven in front of me. Looking over their heads, I see only stone separating You and I. In front of me are the choir, the priests, and the nuns, who I guess had reserved seating and therefore had no need to rush off the bus. I’m closer than I ever dared to imagine. The Basilica faces me and I face it. The twelve Disciples and Jesus are looming above me, each sculpted out of stone and staring over the crowd below. I’ve never seen anything so ominously beautiful. Architecture is powerful. I’m standing at the base of these massive statues and sculpted white stones which all build up a facade that reaches far over my head. I shrink in comparison. I know that this one massive Church, surrounded by dark clouds and heavy rain, has stood firm through centuries. This Square, reverberating with the sounds of organs and song, will continue to go down in history. I am in awe knowing that I am backed by a beauty as great as this. I have no more words. 
As the rain falls, the temperature drops with it. We sit soaked to bone while minutes creep by in utter awfulness. Some people leave but most don’t. Some don’t understand why they are there, and some don’t feel as if they belong, yet the misery of this morning transcends worldly understanding. An hour ticked by, leaving us to endure the next. I dwell in the cold as I did during the measureless hours of my first night here in Rome. I am thankful for those hardships now and am more grateful for what I don’t understand. I’m also learning to be thankful for what I can’t control. I’m thankful that there was no rain during that night in the streets and for finding Drew when he could have been anywhere else in the world. I am thankful for the chance meetings throughout my time in Rome and for the many people I’ve met far from home. No matter whether it is framed as introversion or extroversion, we’re more dependent than I like to think.</p>

<p>An hour ticks by and we face the next.</p>
