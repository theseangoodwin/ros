<p>I remember how dusty clouds of baking flour swirled as Polish, and English, and Portuguese words were spoken into them. When I was young, my whole family baked together and made recipes that were brought over from our homelands. My grandmother quickly swatted the back of my head when I over-zealously mixed the dry ingredients up and into the air or made little animals out of the pierogi.<br />
<br />
I remember energetically directing my brothers and friends as we constructed forts in woods behind the neighborhood. I was the one confirming the perfect spot when we found it and helping the others imagine what the finished structure would look like. When the sun began setting we’d get whistled in for dinner and race out of the treeline back home.<br />
<br />
Idyllic childhood scenes like these abruptly ended when my family divorced in 2008.<br />
<br />
The mortgage collapse ruined my family’s finances and triggered our unraveling. After the departure of my father and my older brother, I took on their roles as a financial partner and the eldest sibling. The heroes that I once thought were flawless – my mother, my father, my extended family – all turned glaringly mortal as they went separate ways.<br />
<br />
We were once a nuclear household of seven consisting of my two parents, my three other brothers, my mother’s sister, and three or four pets. We were often the gathering grounds for parties and holidays. I was 12 when these things stopped happening and when the house started falling apart.<br />
<br />
We could no longer afford the mortgage, A/C, or utilities. The fridge was empty and so was the tank in our car. Our credit score plummeted. We quickly became the eye-sore house in the neighborhood. The yard was overgrown, the pool was green, and the HOA regularly fined us for not keeping up appearances. On the outside everything changed for the worse, and so did I on the inside.<br />
<br />
My priorities shifted away from the things that brought me joy — art, music, fashion, my band, my creativity — and my presence got meek and small. Unlike my peers, I didn’t have the time, money, or emotional capacity to cope with socializing in public school. My reality deviated, I was isolated, and I began to accept the terms of a new norm.<br />
<br />
To support my mother and brothers, I worked my ass off every day after school. As soon as I turned 18, I was made manager of a franchised business and began to see how I could make a future that provided my family with little more than the bare minimum. Every night when I closed the store, I turned the music way up on the sound system and balanced the books in the back office. After work responsibilities were done, I did my homework there late into the night. I had plans to keep that job after graduation. It wasn’t much, but I felt like I had achieved something with my life.</p>

<p>One night, late, my mother pulled me aside and made me make a promise. She said:</p>

<p>“You remember how mad grandma used to get at you for ‘getting creative’ when we baked with them? Or that time I freaked out ‘cause I thought I lost you guys, but you had spent the whole day building a fort in the woods? You are capable of so much more than what you’re doing now…Promise you won’t be like me. Don’t settle. Don’t defeat yourself. Get a degree and learn to believe in yourself.”</p>

<p>I was most courageous when I decided to face my demons, depression, and my abysmal self-esteem. I chose to believe that I was worth more than minimum wage and that I had more to offer the world than just a painstakingly crafted in-store Pandora playlist.</p>

<p>Over a period of years, I’ve gotten closer to the unrelenting, devilish, curious, and endearing spirit with which I was born. Every day I do better at authentically presenting myself and doing so with a child-like enthusiasm. It’s scary and difficult. I harken back to that promise between my mom and I because it represents the most courageous and most rewarding first leap of faith. I make that same step every day, but it’s become easier and easier to do.</p>
