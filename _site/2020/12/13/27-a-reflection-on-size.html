<h1>27. A Reflection on Size</h1>

<p>
  13 Dec 2020
</p>





<p>Just when I begin to feel in control, You bring me here and remind me of my place. I sit at the back of this space against the wall on the bench made for people like me. My eyes move through the emptiness before my feet, filling in the floor as it would have been 800 years ago. My senses are intrigued by the deep colors and glimmering gold, the smell, the sun sifting through the stained glass and dusty air, the fabrics and feel of the hundreds of holy vestments. I look at myself. Who would I have been? Could I have made it here in this building? Is this someplace I would even want to be? The contingency of another lifetime leaves me only with questions. I see the crowds of people who are truly holier than I lined towards the altar. I see the bishops, cardinals, and then the Pope at this time, Benedict XIII. I hear choirs singing praises to the heavens. How many of them acknowledge and appreciate the blessing they’ve been given? Music changes hearts, and yet the mouths the voices come from sometimes leave their own unchanged. I see design, hierarchy, and human next to human piecing together one body. This is one body built from many, and I no longer wonder where my part is in it. I am small. I am an outsider here, an observer to some extent. I watch and I see through the crowd. Their bodies no longer affect my experience, for this room holds only space now. I see You at the front and myself at the back.</p>

<p>Here, in this lifetime, at this year, and in this moment, there is nothing but a stone floor between You and me.</p>
