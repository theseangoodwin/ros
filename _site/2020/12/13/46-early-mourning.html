<h1>46. Early Mourning</h1>

<p>
  13 Dec 2020
</p>





<p>I’m conflicted. I often don’t like myself as a person and today happens to be one of those mornings when I wish there was much more room between me and myself. 
The most beautiful morning emerges from beyond the horizon. The pastel gradient sky touches pale lavender, red, yellow, and green, before spreading across in the most abundant blue. Clouds mix with contrails and compose empty space. These orange strokes are complementary to the water and earth. The scene is a blurry picture that rushes past me. Although the day is still in the making and it may be too early to tell, it is good. Did nature decide this, or did I?</p>

<p>The iron tracks hug the coast. We pass small tucked-in villages with cubed buildings that soak in the sun. I imagine that landscapes such as these are the source of inspiration for realist oil-painters. Renoir, Bonheur, Courbet, and the likes come to mind. Shadows are blue, not black, and they allow for subtle cracks and textures in the shaded areas to remain visible. This blue fills in the sides not lucky enough to feel the rising sun.</p>

<p>I let the colors into my eyes and realize that beauty does not merely exist in immensely complex and arduous works. Beauty may be simple and often times it is. It can be an accident. When a community comes together, it rarely happens all at one time or with one final product in mind. Construction can be entirely serendipitous. These buildings were made one after another as a means to an end. There are lessons to be learned from the homes that cluster in the crests of the rolling terrain, or the chapel with a pointed steeple adorning the top of the highest point. The little villages quietly command attention as we pass. They are either too small or we are moving too fast. We pass so quickly that these thoughts are written from brief memories. The train comes up on more elaborate constructions.</p>

<p>Big businesses, industrial parks, and factories smog up the sky. You can’t see the pollution once the smoke assimilates into the rest of the blue, but I know it’s there. I know that the imposturous chemicals can find no escape except in camouflage. I know that the air above the polluting smokestacks is changing for the worse once the gray fades and separates. Rusty gray pylons and conveyor belts hang around like broken appendages. Limp and lifeless, they bend at the whim of their designers. Beauty has been sacrificed for productivity and efficiency. The factory is one body built to serve a single purpose. Where are the good looks in that? 
There is a parking lot, but it is empty. What’s going on inside the factory while no one is there? This industrialized view, unfortunately, stays around for much longer than the small villages. We move and it moves with us, dragging behind and begging for attention.</p>

<p>We escape it when my window turns black. Beneath cement and earth, we duck down and leave the factory behind.</p>
