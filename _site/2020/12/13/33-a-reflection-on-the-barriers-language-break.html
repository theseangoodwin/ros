<h1>33. A Reflection on the Barriers  Language Break </h1>

<p>My relationship with my new peers is unique and unlike any that I’ve ever had before. I barely speak French and they barely speak English. A large amount of the words we use back home are unknown to the non-native, and often are not even used in the way that their definition suggests. I notice something similar here. There is a point where we begin to bend the rules of what our words mean and our emotions move the messages in between the lines. Colloquialisms fill in the spaces our words decorate. Neither side has this luxury anymore if they hope to get their point across. We are often limited to the most basic vocabulary and must present ideas in the most honest way. This is the result of honest relationship building. There is no mincing of words or annotating of speech bubbles here. We present what we have, stripped of all hidden agendas. For my overly-active mind and socially anxious self, this has been an unexpected breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>There is something to be said for the exchange students from the States as well. There is a strong sense of alignment between us—an acknowledgement that we are all up against the same difficulties and are just trying to piece together these accented vowels and backwards adjectives.</p>
