    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    

<h1>28. Avignon: Near Glass Houses</h1>

<p>
  13 Dec 2020
</p>





<p>I spent the second half of the day with new people. I’m a young American armed with a camera who relies on charisma and spontaneity. One photo-op that I couldn’t pass up resulted in my meeting Morgan and Bolgarov right outside of the city walls. They were on their bikes in front of the stone city ramparts. I saw them marking up the garden terraces and modern cement underpass near the highway. They welcomed my camera and my simple French.</p>

<p>Morgan excitedly took me around the gardens and shared the lines he had been working on. He and his bike moved like I had never seen before. He managed to get up on a 5-foot planter, balance on a thin ledge, and then cleanly get back down. Since I was too surprised to take a decent photo, I could only look at him wide-eyed with a goofy smile on my face. I let him know that I missed the shot, and so he and I toured the grounds, while Bolgarov practiced near the wall. Both of them consistently surprised me. We began as three, but before I knew it others were joining us, hopping out of cars on the highway and from behind the wall to meet up with us. We were eight by the end of the night, moving from spot to spot in the city laughing, taking photos, talking, and asking questions about one another. At the square in front of the palace, a friend was waiting with a Spanish guitar, a cajón, and a puppy — a good combo if you ask me. We played music and sang just like back home. I felt comfortable, especially considering that I am way off of my schedule.</p>

<p>The sun set, it got cold, and I wanted to eat. They wanted McDonald’s and I did not. I did not come to Europe to pay 10 euros for a Big Mac when I could get a great bottle of wine for the same price. Before I left the group for my meal, we connected on Facebook, said our goodbyes, bises, and did that French double-tap handshake that I still don’t think is that cool.</p>
