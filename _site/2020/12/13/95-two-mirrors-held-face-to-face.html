<h1>95. Two Mirrors Held Face to Face</h1>

<p>Fluorescent lights reflect off plastic cups and spilled liquor. Blue-green glass bottles line the tables. The sea foam walls are stained and the kitchen sinks don’t drain. Pasta is glued to the sides of the pot and stuck to the backsplash.
My elbow is resting in a small puddle on the table, but I ignore the dampness on my clothes. Instead, I focus on the conversation.</p>

<p>Conversations like these are few and far between. It’s expansive and rewarding and challenging all at the same time. I hate parties because I’m not good at being superficial. Thankfully, this conversation is anything but. The bass echoes off the tile floor and low-hanging ceiling. There’s loud yelling back and forth between crowded people, which doesn’t make it any easier to listen.</p>

<p>He travels on his own like I do. He’s seen much of Europe and its cities, and recognizes the value of exploring alone. Traveling like this is an expression of vulnerability that changes the way that others perceive you. However, traveling alone can change the course of your life only if you let it.</p>

<p>I want to be as vulnerable as possible, but I struggle to convey the emotions I feel in meeting someone from across the globe who is so similar to me. It’s a bizarre idea, but I could have this same conversation with myself. Our perspectives are very similar.</p>

<p>No matter what words I use to explain what two mirrors held face to face look like, I will never be able to express either the effect of seeing the glass, or what it feels like unless you’ve seen it yourself. Even if you’ve seen it, maybe your experience was different. Maybe you do know what infinity looks like, but it actually was a totally negligible moment in your life. Maybe you aren’t as impressed by theoretical distance as I am. So, it is true for this little act of storytelling. It consists of me repeating brief moments over and over in my head as I try to pick the perfect adjective to characterize the action, the speaker, or the moment. This book is my attempt to capture the experiences that have changed my life. I want so badly to share them with you. I know, however, that their power will be lost in translation from my eyes to your head, much like holding two mirrors held face to face.</p>
