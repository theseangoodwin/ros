<p>“Great. I have some questions below so you can have some food for thought. I’ll follow up in March and see if that would be a good time for you to provide responses or if you’d like to wait a bit. Also, if you have a headshot and/or any pictures of the university and your study abroad experience, we would love to include those as well. Thank you very much for your help with this. I’ll be sure to let you know when the article is published.</p>

<p>Please tell me all about your study abroad trip. I want to know what you are studying/ what classes are you taking and how does this apply to your major? Why did you choose Kedge in Marseille, France? How long will you be there?”</p>

<p>Courses: Organizational Behavior, Principles of Marketing, Sustainable Development, Management Information Systems</p>

<p>KEDGE Business School is within the top circle for the Grand Ecole system in France. It is a well-respected college on an international level and has a local reputation of being reserved for the best in the city. Marseille itself is the second largest city in France. The Vieux Port was among the first in the world to link intercontinental trade and has been the business hub of the continent and much of the world for 26 centuries. Its location is the access point across the Mediterranean Sea to trade in North Africa and the Middle East. Both of these areas and their many cultures are represented here. While the strict French typecast is present, there is a much broader level of international diversity in the streets, businesses, and the KEDGE campus. It’s similar to GMU in a lot of ways and I do feel that the diversity in our school has prepared me for international life like this.</p>

<p>“Which study abroad programs did you look at and why did you choose the one you did?”</p>

<p>There weren’t many options for me. I’ve studied French for four years and am committed to putting French fluency on my resume. This commitment lead me to KEDGE. It’s a direct exchange program which makes the application and credit transfer very simple. I told myself that if I was going to learn a language, I was going to learn it from its source, and this city and the people have been very helpful in getting me to that point. I’ve developed familiarity with the language much more than I’ve been able to in the classroom.</p>

<p>“What are you looking forward to most during this experience? What do you anticipate being your key takeaway from this trip- personally and to apply to the business world?”</p>

<p>This trip has presented me with many great opportunities. The one I look forward to most is celebrating Easter at St. Peter’s Square with Pope Francis. In only two months, however, I’ve been able to do some incredible things. I’ve toured South France, skied the Alps, learned French from native speakers, rented my first apartment, thrived in global diversity, developed my career, and made connections that will last long after I touch back down at Dulles. A concise list is no longer possible because my time abroad has developed nearly every part of my personality. I set out with the goal to consolidate the traits of my role model. I’ve done that and more.</p>

<p>“Any advice for students considering studying abroad at Mason?”</p>

<p>Studying abroad is a commitment that anyone who is considering surely realizes. My advice before making any serious decision is to make sure that the product sits well with your head and your heart. If the three don’t make sense together, you’ll eventually reach a point where you question your decision. If you question, you’ll be led to doubt and doubt leads to regret. The last thing you want to do is regret being alone on a flight out of the country for half a year.</p>

<p>There has to be purpose for you to study abroad, whether it’s for credits toward your degree or for the language. Logically justify why you want to do it and what it will do for you. Secondly, make sure you’re emotionally invested in the challenge. Love the idea of what the time away will do to you, set goals to keep yourself on track, and be prepared to be uncomfortable nearly every day while you’re away. Know that things will go wrong and you will miss whatever you’ve left back home.</p>

<p>“What does it mean to you to be awarded the Gilman Scholarship? Can you tell me a bit about the application process for you?”</p>

<p>It means a great deal to have been given the Gilman Scholarship. I’ve taken a piece from the last paragraph of one of my application essays. I spoke honestly when I said:</p>

<p>“I will proudly carry the name of Mr.Gilman. Receiving his scholarship would alleviate the costs of the exchange, but more than that, it would reaffirm solidarity within myself… The ever-prevalent idea that we are the ultimate determinants of our own happiness is nothing without the participation of others…”</p>

<p>The Gilman International Scholarship sees what I am doing. They’ve read my intentions as I carefully poured my heart into their essay windows and they stand behind my endeavors. Their support is invaluable. No matter how much I want to be independent and for success to come by my own hand, we will be able to achieve more, faster, when we learn to be interdependent.</p>

<p>By looking to Gilman for help, I was required to be vulnerable and to put myself on the line. It cost me time and a lot of it. I spent at least an hour a day for the better part of the summer months writing the essays, hunting for the most concise way to speak about the depth of my past, and the goals I have for the future. 
“What has been your favorite experience while studying abroad thus far?”</p>

<p>I’ve recently returned from London with some students at KEDGE. The Commission des Opérations Boursières et Financiers (COBFI) is one of the school’s business organizations. It has just paired with the London School of Economics (LSE) and got our group a spot in a lecture with some professors from the University. Professor Alan Manning and Nicola Smith lead a discussion afterwards that gave me insight to the differences between the US minimum wage and the UK wage. It’s been interesting to see the differences between cultures in the most basic parts of society. These are the things I have never thought of any differently and, frankly, didn’t think any other way existed.</p>

<p>The day after the lecture at LSE we toured London, I had some time with a few friends I met in Barcelona, and the evening was spent in the Bloomberg London offices. I’m not a math person. I barely got out of Hylton’s accounting class and yet I really enjoyed my time with the company. While the majority of the evening was spent talking numbers and using the Bloomberg Terminal, I was able to break away from the group and sit down at the workspace with one of the company’s marketing project managers. She and I spoke about her daily schedule, opportunities within the company, and also about my potential involvement. In this meeting I got well-needed perspective and am tempted to write about how this experience is going to change my career concretely.</p>

<p>The truth is that I don’t know exactly what is to come for me and this semester has made me fully understand that. I work hard and get involved with those things I think are admirable, but truthfully I only have intuition to go off of. What I do know now is that I’m on the cusp of some big opportunities, the likes of which I didn’t think would come so soon. My goals grow very fast and I’m told, “go big or go home, right?” I’ve decided I don’t want to go home.</p>
