<h1>60. A Reflection on Mechanisms and Their Relationship to Falling Dust | Rite of Spring</h1>

<p>Metallic buzz, cold reverb, still air, and nothingness. There’s blank space between my eyes and the shivering stones of this Gothic church. I sit and stare blankly, noticing the momentary speckles of falling dust. They glisten. I’m at peace until a strange man steps into the sanctuary. He’s dressed in all black but is not a priest. He looks tiny because the ceiling hangs and looms ominously above his dusty brown head. His soft-heeled shoes make more sound than they should in this quiet place. It’s early evening. The tranquil specks drift through the stained light that gleams in the fading sun. Heel, toe, heel, toe, with purpose and pattern, his steps break the air. My neck turns so my eyes can follow him. He reaches the center of the marble altar, clicks his ankles together, and bends at the waist in a way that makes me think that he cracked his spine in a few places. He straightens his back, puts his hands down to his side, and continues on his way. He steps diagonally up onto the altar and then to the lectern.</p>

<p>I’ve finally found the buzzing sound. It is the anxiety that sparsely fills the void from the high-backed pews to the ceiling. The man touches the little microphone once and it reacts to him three times. Sounds of his finger echoes down the aisle. The wiring whines as it is probed to stand taller and nearly touch the man’s lips. He steps away and leaves its space. He moves back, following his old footsteps exactly. I follow him back across the altar and watch as he leaves the room.</p>

<p>I look back to the lectern. The buzzing grows, cycling through the microphone and speakers, starting at a mumble and then turning into a pitched hum. It is a subtle call for help that sounds with more and more haste. It swells until it loses its innocent tickle. The mouth widens and the chords rub against one another. Some treacherous being has come from the dark crypts below. Its cold stone teeth and stained-glass eyes widen with ferocity. It rises through the floor and violently erupts with ash and dust. The screams from the damsel fill the room and multiply on their way back and forth between the walls. The bitter black particles flood the space and then collapse over the soundwaves.</p>

<p>Her echoes are abruptly suppressed and silence moves back in. The once prismatic windows are now shattered. The man in black comes back. She quietly begs for his help. Kneeling before him and wrapping her hand around the back of his leg, she gently touches his chin. He is not moved. Removing her arm from his body and circling around, he covers her mouth and pulls her back into the slow-moving, billowy ash.</p>

<p>The dust settles, there’s a low hum, and cold reverb moves back through the room.</p>
