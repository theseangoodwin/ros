<h1>69. A Reflection on the Movement of  Money: Water and Diamond </h1>

<p>Rich and poor; normal and abnormal; perception, pride, lust, and happiness. Do I dare say that the common thread between all of them is currency? I’ve seen more money move in a few days than ever before. I remember when I was a kid and thought a lot of money was $20. That quickly became $100, $100 become $1,000, and now it sits at $10,000. When I was 15 and first received paychecks, the cash coming my way made me feel like a king for a day. Here in Paris, I’m looking at price tags marked at $14,000 for an ugly bag or $15,000 for a watch. I will never forget witnessing the flippant decision between two four-digit and equally useless (and ugly) handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I could justify any of these purchases at any point in my life. These thousands of euros, dollars, and pounds (of flesh) could change the life of someone else. For $10,000, the price of two semesters at university, I could get a man off the streets and bring him to self-sufficiency. I could develop 3rd world communities and change the standards of living for hundreds of people with $15,000. My eyes and my head can’t comprehend the blind vision of the lucky few buying Givenchy, Bulgari, Fendi, Fendi, Louis, Louis, Prada trash.</p>

<p>(Look up Kreayshawn, “Gucci Gucci.”)</p>
