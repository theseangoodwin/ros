<h1>54. On the Folly of Rewarding  A While Hoping for B</h1>

<p>
  13 Dec 2020
</p>




<p>London has gone dry despite the weather and I shrink. I hoped that this trip would be a source of inspiration, but I find none here. The throngs of people and drinks create semi-reflective conversations, but they are shallow and quickly drain. I can hardly keep my thoughts.</p>

<p>I look over my shoulder to see the rain drizzling down from the gray evening sky. It’s not a heavy rain; it’s light and a bit refreshing. I stop moving in order to take in the scene and let the water drip from my lashes to obscure the commotion of the streets. The mediocre advertisements, neon signs, headlights, vibrant refractions of red double-decker buses, cellphones, and police flashers spread out before me as I squint my eyes. They create a collage that moves in real-time. 
My eyes let in more light when I relax my pupils. I allow the objects to fall further from focus in order to let their shapes grow larger and larger. Slowly, inspiration blooms.</p>

<p>I balance between the blurriness and my mind’s desire to understand the details. The colors are free of form and my mind can’t stand it. Suddenly, a final set of headlights turn the corner closest to me and painfully enter through my eyes. I tightly close them and rub my face.</p>

<p>Turning back, I tighten my backpack and catch up to the group.</p>
