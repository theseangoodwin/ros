<h1>37. East & West Coast Come Together For an  Agreeable Day in Barcelona</h1>

<p>
  13 Dec 2020
</p>




<p>The bus pulls into the station and the city is still dark. My mind is blurry from the wildly disorienting late night ride from Marseille. I spent yesterday in my apartment slowly working on a presentation concerning the broad topic of ‘leadership.’</p>

<p>I get off the bus in groggy disarray from a cold’s onset and from 9 sleepless hours in a cramped space. My pursed eyes and scratchy throat are making it difficult to enjoy my arrival to Barcelona. I step down and pass a few other riders while I look for a place to sit, recuperate, and pull together a plan for when the sun rises. I cross the horseshoe-shaped cobblestone bus bay, under street lights that are notably different from the color I remember back home. These are gentler and have a warmness about them that isn’t so abrasive against the sleeping world. I enter through a slow-to-react automatic door and sit down for a moment. It isn’t long before another rider from the bus promptly approaches me and extends her hand for an introduction.</p>

<p>Becca is from San Francisco and is taking courses in Aix-en-Provence, majoring in French and anthropology. She is 20 years old, finishing her Bachelor’s Degree in a total of six years, has her septum pierced, and wears clothes that befit a true frenchie. At heart however, Becca is a Californian, born and raised. She’s a photographer and I can tell she has quite the eye for it by the way she sporadically pulls out her camera. Needless to say, I’m excited to be meeting someone that looks like the kind of person I would choose to get to know. Diversity is important for a group, but every now and then it’s nice to relate to a person because of similarities and not differences. With no additional direction, we take to the streets. She talks well and thinks even better. Becca is a critic of all the external forces around her. Political oppression, humanistic causes, child labor, and material consumption; you name it, she’s thought about it. If she hasn’t, she won’t fib her way through or change the subject. If she doesn’t know, then she doesn’t know, and that’s easy enough for her to say. She is cautious of both the things she lets into her life and how those things represent who she is</p>

<p>In the dark, we search for food, criticize street art, and learn about one another. For a moment, the ‘east versus west coast’ debate flares but quickly gives way for the sake of civility. I’m uninterested in this battle of bias and thankfully she is too. Since I’m unsure of how long our time together will be, I hesitate to offer the food I packed for today. Food is my best friend. As we walk I notice both of us mentally slipping, distracted by our stomachs. The conversation spreads and gets notably slower. Our steps up the hill push breath between our words. I cave and offer to share what I’ve packed for myself. We pick a bench in one of Barcelona’s many city parks to become our table.</p>

<p>A stagnant brass two-story fountain is to my left and another warm street light shines down on our wooden bench. We are in a closed-off bubble built from the brightness and shadow cast by the light above. Like looking out of a window at night, we can’t see out, but others can see in. We went back and forth about art, sociology, and our goals. She is kind and, within these first hours, I see admirable integrity.</p>
