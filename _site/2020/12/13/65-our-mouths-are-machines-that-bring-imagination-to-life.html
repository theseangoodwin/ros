<h1>65. Our Mouths are Machines That  Bring Imagination to Life</h1>

<p>I told K. I didn’t expect to and didn’t want to tell anyone. It’s not theirs to worry about. She called with explicitly no purpose, with nothing to say other than ‘hello.’ The thought came to my mind and I held it in, but I wanted so badly to let it go. I don’t want to hold this in because it’s not easy to cope by myself. While Easter threatens my life, life itself is not mine to hold onto. She told me that through her actions. I am not in control and she changed me. She changes me into something shaky and uncomposed. I don’t want to talk about myself when I listen to her because I know my voice. I want to understand hers. I try harder to be better because of her.</p>

<p>I told her about my death, what I never want to tell anyone about. It’s difficult to trust people, and with her I hand over control so easily.</p>
