<p>Tyler Durdon called it when he looked to camera in Fight Club and said, “You’re not your fuckin’ khakis.” Gone are the days of the monolith and blind consumerism. In order to make it now, brands need clarity to navigate new complexity in the world as well as creativity to be the change customers want to see in it.\</p>

<p>Clarity has always been an important part of a brand’s success, it’s just evolved with time. In the 50’s Volvo marketed safety– and that’s it. The only thing you had to do to sell those cars was write some copy about safety, put the logo in the bottom corner, and then families with young kids would buy that brand of car over others. The important part is that Volvo knew safety was their schtick.\</p>

<p>In the 80’s and 90’s new technologies became viable for business, we saw an increased importance of data to support marketing claims, the whole dot com mess happened, and then trailblazers like Amazon, Wegmans, and Southwest started customizing brand experiences for more and more specific segments of consumers. With consumer’s demand for specificity came a need for greater detail in the brand’s identity. That means more articulate advertisements and a more flexible identity system.\</p>

<p>We’re at a point now where the market runs rampant with digital natives. Companies like Warby Parker, Casper, and Blue Apron prove it’s possible to replace in-person brand touchpoints with entirely digital ones. This opportunity requires next-gen clarity in order to navigate the evolving digital landscape.\</p>

<p>Clarity empowers brands to express themselves instinctually. It, much like our own personalities, informs how and why we respond to the world. A brand with a high level of clarity does not get bogged down in discerning how to present itself across platforms, it just does. The brand is able to tailor touchpoints to drive core values and tell compelling stories. This leads to why companies need creativity.\</p>

<p>Creativity is needed to break through the noise. In the market today that means competing on social values and social media. Companies that are confident in their core pillars, tone of voice, and visual identity are able to multiply their impact through their customer-base. By entrusting communities with a company’s brand, the two parties are able to drive the change they want to see in the world and win on loyalty. Companies that compete on these social values garner success and greater relevance against competitors.\</p>

<p>The Ben and Jerry’s business manifesto is founded on social values. When George Floyd was murdered the company responded and offered its platform to the Black Lives Matter movement. To combat criticism, the company cited archives of their practiced approach of supporting the company’s core beliefs. Based on that exchange and prevailing customer-centrism in business today, it’s evident that companies will be expected to no longer just be bystanders. It is expected that they be active partners in social change.\</p>

<p>Key to community-driven social change is the elasticity of a company’s brand. Elasticity demands clarity as a prerequisite and relies on creativity to act on happenstance. For better or worse, no one really wants to hear a blank recitation of core beliefs and tweets saying, “I told you so.” The value for both companies and society is derived from the creativity with which a statement is made. Campaigns, for lack of a better word, like Ben and Jerry’s presents a more heartening, more dimensional perception of the company.\</p>

<p>I think of Ben and Jerry’s, Bezos, Gates, and Musk as leaders in this change. They all are public figures who serve as figureheads for the company. It feels natural for them to lead the way in this evolution of brand. I’m interested to see how brands change in this way without literally personifying their company to the market. Then again, maybe there is some sort of Philip K. Dick science-fiction future with brand androids living and socializing with humans….\</p>

<p>Clarity is needed to navigate the evolving business landscape of the world today. Creativity is needed to break through the noise and sell the message. For the time being, these two words humanize our understanding of what it means to be a company in the world today.</p>
