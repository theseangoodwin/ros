<blockquote>“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. <span class="blackletter">Our deepest fear</span> is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, ‘Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, [exceptional]?’ <a>Actually, who are you not to be?</a> ... Your <strike>playing small</strike> does not serve the world. *There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.* <span class="sans">We are all meant to shine, as children do. (We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone.) And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.</span> As we are liberated from our own fear, <span class="blackletter">our presence automatically liberates others.</span>”</blockquote>

<p>—Marianne Williamson</p>
