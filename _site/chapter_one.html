<p>I think back to where I began. When I was a kid, I would imagine what being older was like. I looked to the future and imagined how my life would be different. I thought about starting a career that would become large and impactful. I thought about my skills and hobbies that I would hone with time. I thought about all of the things that a child doesn’t understand yet.</p>

<p>Step by step, I made my way until I came upon the benchmark for my coming of age. I hunted for what I believed would change my personality instantly. I searched for something that would lead me to be satisfied with who and what I was. I felt too boring, too fat, not interesting, and entirely missable.</p>

<p>My friends and I were a small, unpopular group of high school students. One day, we were sitting in the back row of our computer science classroom. I remember that I barely learned how to code that year and that I scored a zero on my AP exam. In the last fifteen minutes of the class, we talked and laughed freely about graduation and college plans and made dumb jokes about one another. My closest friend looked over at me and spoke his mind like I had never heard before. His words fell through my cavernous self and echo still:</p>

<blockquote>“You will always be tragically average.”</blockquote>

<p>This phrase comes to mind every couple of months. You will always be tragically average. As if it wasn’t supposed to be. And as if I was meant to be better but something was holding me back. “Average” meaning that I was like most people; that although I was trying to be excellent, I would inevitably fall face forward on mediocrity. As if I wasn’t damaged enough, those words cut deep. I don’t know what he was trying to say, if he meant it, or if he spoke maliciously, but it sure as hell felt like it.</p>

<p>Weeks later, I left for college and we all went our separate ways. I was determined to better my family’s standard of living and to be a model for my younger brothers. I worked hard to support my mother. I battled severe depression, abysmal self-esteem, and a slew of personality disorders. I worked diligently with the sole intention of making the lives of my loved ones easier. Two years later, I look back to where I began. I recognize the changes that I missed when I was younger. When I look in the mirror, I see myself the way others do. I am everything that I wished I would become in those childish fantasies.</p>

<p>I search for some definition. <a>Some stake in the ground that I can point to and blame for the complicated, curious, and passionate person I’ve become.</a> I’ve learned that there is no single line, however. I discovered that for years I walked uphill without noticing the slope. It is a steady grade that, now from the cliffs overlooking the waves, has strengthened who I am today. Knife fights, dangerously dark nights, and psychological abuse will turn any boy into a man. I was a child convinced that I was born useless, but now I have been made into something more than circumstances would suggest.</p>

<p>The following pages are my monument. They are built with my own two hands. They are a collection of thoughts and perspectives from the time I will spend living, studying, and travelling in France. As I write, I promise honesty and commitment. The final product will be the summation of who I am in the present day. At the threshold of some unknown adventure, I begin on terrain that will challenge my standards and test my wit against that of the world.</p>

<p>This book is not about faces; it is not about specificities. These entries are more than my casual writing and lack-luster photography will be able to convey. The book, like water, has many forms. Some entries are matter of fact, clear, and to the point. Through these writings, I’ve learned to appreciate words for their utility in capturing moments and in understanding the way I relate to experiences. You’ll see that these first entries have been used as something like a <span class="blackletter">coping mechanism</span> in unfamiliar territory. Others are less explicit, however. I look at the world around me and am baffled by its complexities. I have questions that I try to understand by narrating my thoughts. When I am confident in my surroundings, you’ll notice a shift in my writing. It reflects my inner peace and ability to think freely. These writings take the form of reflections on various topics or abstracted thoughts.</p>

<p>Look at the book as an adventure. Open to any page and see that I’ve worked hard on each one; they are gems in my eyes. My hope is that they sparkle just as beautifully in yours and, furthermore, that the reflections inspire you to look further.</p>

                <h4 class="location">On the plane</h4>
            </div>
                
            <div class="content_div"><p>A few days before my departure, I showed my mother the basilica in Marseille. She taught me about relics, which sent me on a seemingly elusive quest for a piece of history. It wasn’t long before history made its way to me.</p>

<p><br />
At this altitude, we are all a little bit closer to heaven. The ones we love and miss are only just outside of this metal tube miraculously soaring through the sky. The stewardess sees me moving my fingers through the rosary hanging around my neck, just like my mother always does before flying. She interrupts and we begin an intermittent 6-hour conversation, the kind that is built bit by bit as she walks around the plane. She spends slightly more time pouring drinks and joking with me than attending to the rest of the passengers.</p>

<p><br />
I notice something very admirable about her. It’s her voice. The way she speaks to others, like the German families returning to Frankfurt from vacation or the businessmen heading abroad for work, is not limited by language. She knows how to relate to each individual and builds rapport that seems effortless, for both her and for whomever she talks with. It’s as if she doesn’t think about it. She laughs with everyone and presents herself in a way that makes it easy to react, even at 4:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><br />
The plane is dark for the final hour of the flight. The plane’s passengers are beginning to arise out of restlessness. The stewardess quickly approaches me from behind and pushes my shoulder from the armrest. “A present for you,” she says, and places a small something in my possession. She makes no eye contact with me, although I was looking for it. She continues down the dim aisle toward the front of the plane, walks past a set of dark blue curtains, and tightly draws them after passing. I am distracted by a sense of secrecy and abnormality about her. In my palm, I find a small circular box that somehow also has corners. I want to use my light to see more clearly, but also don’t want to draw attention to the stewardess if she was in fact trying to be quiet about her present. I pull off the lid, as if it would help me see through the darkness of the cabin. I only see darkness, but the smell that comes from the inside of the box is one from my childhood. It is a spice and sweetness that collects in your throat and lingers there for a while before your body accepts its warmth as something wholly comforting. It is as familiar as walking into an old church parish. The smell is sharp, striking, and I choke a little bit, but it is ultimately beautiful, just like the rosary that lies in the box.</p>

<p><br />
My mind is drawn back to the final hours of my Grandmother’s life. I see her in her hospital bed surrounded by her disunified family. She’s covered in a pale blue loose-knit blanket made by her children, the kind that doesn’t protect you from the cold. I look at my young self sitting hunched over on a bench in the corner of the hospital room. I watch myself look at anything but the bed in the middle of the space and am grateful that I can’t see past the small crowd of people that surround her.</p>

<p><br />
I didn’t see it happen. It doesn’t matter where I am, even if I had the opportunity to see, I wouldn’t have been able to watch her die. My eyes close tightly. M y tears swim The day she died was close to the day I turned thirteen. I didn’t know how to handle the selfish side of me that just wanted a normal birthday. I was too young, too egocentric. I had never dealt with anything like this before, and the ideas I previously held of life and death never focused much on death.</p>

<p><br />
My innocence and my unfailing optimism left on that day and followed her. I cling to this unfortunate fact as if it is some sort of celestial proof that she and I had a relationship that was unlike those I had with rest of my family — as if it were an alibi justifying my absence from her side. It provided some meager consolation to the boy who wasn’t strong enough to hold back the tears from his eyes. I wish that I said goodbye. I wish I was strong enough to look at her and tell her that I loved her. I was the only one not there. Self-pity, loss, and change: the three threats that convinced my adolescent mind to hide high up in the clouds.</p>

<p><br />
Back in the sky, I decided to use the light above my head to dimly illuminate the contents of the box. The beads are a pale painted red and worn. The wood’s grain, however, is not hidden beneath the paint. The decades coil around a thick metal cross depicting a shepherd who carries a sheep over his shoulders. The smell fills the cabin and I start to notice my neighbors reacting to it. I close the lid, conceal the box in my hands, and turn off the spotlight. It is a beautiful gift – a birthday present. I feel safe and cared for.</p>

<p><br />
My spine shivers from these emotions that I’ve never experienced before. I write to articulate to myself how I feel. I feel here and now the undeniable existence of heaven and its relevance to our lives. I know that my Grandmother is well because the poignant scent of the rosary is the loving kiss she gave me before sending me off alone.</p>

<p><br />
The stewardess emerges back through the curtains, looks into my eyes, and places on my fold-down dinner table a documented relic, a piece of John Paul II’s robe. She walks away and that is the last I see of her.<br />
Her name was Edna.</p>

After my departure was delayed a week because of visa complications, I finally have the time to refocus and muster my attention. Sometimes I forget that I am never alone. My desire for a better life pushes me to do the best that I can in the present moment. When I fail, I tear myself apart believing that I’ve sacrificed some unknown addition to the future. I have been asked to become more dependent; to piece myself together from my innately flawed humanity. I try.</p>

<p>I ask for humility, for honesty, and for a particular openness to vulnerability: to acknowledge the past and to be present for the future. You and I are closer than I’ve ever felt before now that I’m losing all senses of familiarity. I tread lightly into the water and try to imagine emerging on top on the other side. You and I: <span class="blackletter">Communion</span>.<br />
<br />
My school, jobs, friendships, meetings, and focus all combine together in this moment. Right here, right now. I’ve worked hard to get myself into this seat. Now is not the time to let my nerves get the best of me. I am not scared, but I do question whether this is too good to be true. I am skeptical. I am jaded. I write to leave my baggage on the tarmac and I also write to pick up my few belongings in order to push the boundaries of character.</p>

            <div class="content_div"><p>Today I walk with purpose. Two days of life through a scavenger’s eyes has caused me to warmly welcome adequacy back to my side along with some new friends. I was only able to quickly stop by Camion de Snack to repay my debt to Martine and to pick up a water bottle before class. I make my way to my last class of the week, which also happens to be the first one I’ve been able to attend. Just outside the classroom, a scattered student mass begins to gather, waiting for the room to be available. Now is the first time that I’ve had a real chance to observe the smartly dressed and put-together typecast that is the French student body. Ladies and gentlemen, they care about the way they look. No ‘comfy’ clothes for lounging in lecture halls here. Dudes are wearing fitted slacks, tees, and the classic euro side-bags, while the women are completely blowing the American girls out of the water. Absolutely beautiful. And even more beautiful is the way they carry themselves. I turn to a relatably styled classmate next to me and introduce myself. She is tall, has mysterious eyes, and the persona to match. She is from Canada so of course I am the one who breaks the French a couple of moments into the conversation. She has an air about her that I wholeheartedly respect. Something like a subdued congeniality that asks me to appreciate the smallest details of her mannerisms. Her smile is honest and tells me that she appreciates our time together. Her name is Cynthia and I appreciated our time together as well.</p>

<p>I spend the majority of this class with a group of nine fellow students in the back of the classroom. There seems to be an existing friendship between all of the other people in the group. I’m not sure if this is the case or if the friendly camaraderie I’ve been shown these past couple of days is expedited without a language barrier. I am impressed with the productivity of our time together. From my first impression of the classroom, I expected something very different. There are archetypes you can pick out in any group. For a classroom, these may include the Clown: looking for an audience; Mr. Cool: sitting on a desk; Madam Popular: roping another person into closing the window she just opened moments ago; the list goes on and on. But when the time comes, these differences are discarded in favor of getting the work done. I am now comfortable saying that this is the best group I’ve ever worked with. We are able to divide and delegate tasks by volunteering rather than wasting time accusing other members of not stepping up to the plate. This is asset-based community building in a pure and natural situation. It may even be more beautiful than the French women. No. I’m going to take that one back. Productivity is beautiful in a different way.</p>

<p>I made shopping plans with a guy named Enzo from my group. He’s going to <a>show me some of the stores where I can buy things that will help me to stop living like a bum</a>—but that’s tomorrow.</p>
