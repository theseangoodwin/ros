      <p>28 Jul 2020</p>
      
      <p>What is it about the nature of odd or even that influences our minds? I am told to always design in odd numbers. However, we sometimes need elements to stick out, and at other times, we want to blend in, especially now in foreign territory. The holiness of the number seven is so close to the menace of six yet infinitely more superior. We try our entire lives to bridge the gap of one and many can’t. The love of three parts created a single One, to come onto Earth to demystify the path leading from one to the other. Simplicity, I fear, makes things more difficult. Knowing the odds you’re up against reveals the opposition we face. For someone like myself, that opposition often seems too large to overcome.<br />
The difference One makes in the scale of eternity is far greater than I ever imagined. The name makes it accessible. Close enough to achieve, but not quite within reach. I continue with the odds in my favor; I’ll take all the help I can get.</p>

      <p>What if in my dreams, my death was only a dream? My visions of blood and pain, of sacrifice and courage, may not allude to my future in the way that I believe they do. The thought of death is so real that it is avoided. Who thinks about dying? Who thinks about how they will die? When you picture the face of death, can it look so real that it moves you to tears? Do you see the bloodshot eyes and mournful actions that follow death?<br />
I’ve thought about this at length. Several days ago, I wrote letters for my mother to find in case something happened to me today. Those are words that I never want to read again. I never want her to read them; yet it felt as if I had no other choice but to die for something worthy of the love she’s given me. I would die for her. That’s not easy to say, because I mean it. The love she’s given me is unfailing, whole, and holy. The Savior I seek has been raising me from birth.<br />
I know what it means to sacrifice your life for another, so I would never say this lightly. I know the sickening feeling in my stomach. Like the imminence of death to a poisonous exposure, this feeling courses through my veins. Where can it go that I have not already been? I am, from now on, dying everyday. I will not speak life into death by acknowledging it. Let it be as it is supposed to be. I will live unafraid of the end because the end is infinitely closer to where I now stand. I will run to the future laid before me and to the mile markers I pass. I chase as if there is something or someone to catch up to.</p>

      <p>28 Jul 2020</p>
      
      <p>It’s late and I watch the sun set with disappointment. I still don’t know where I’m staying tonight. I may bring myself to find a place, but I’ll probably convince myself otherwise. I am pushed onto the streets against my will just like I thought and dreamed. I face the west. Despite what I want, ambition keeps me to my word. “It’s one night,” I tell myself. It’s one out of a thousand that the homeless face. My internal conflict switches sides quickly and I lean back and forth. The eight euros that I spent on my hostel for the night weigh heavily on my mind. It’s cold, it’s not safe, and someone could steal my backpack if I fall asleep. If my phone and wallet were taken from me, I would feel it in the pit of my stomach for months to come. The money and documentation that were so difficult to obtain would be a nightmare to replace. I realize that I am risking more than just my possessions.<br />
My heart is torn between two individuals. Half belongs to the person that I want to be, while the other to the person that I am now. I give reason after reason to escape this self-deprecating inner conversation. Every time, however, my conscience comes full circle and keeps me involved. This vicious cycle resorts back to one idea consistently: “I am not intimidated by the devil.” I battle between the choice of bed or concrete. My hip flexor, my blisters, and my knee all twinge painfully. I lean on the short stone wall that overlooks the river and hang my head low between my shoulders.<br />
While I do not know what will happen, I choose to face the streets tonight. It surely goes against the advice of all others back home and their response may be resoundingly negative when they find out. Tomorrow my decision will be justified. I will have perspective and experience, which I value beyond the threat to my safety. I didn’t think I would make it to Italy, yet here I am alive and well. Here begins life like it won’t last.<br />
I step in for dinner at a humble cafe. The gelato there is old and served after being frozen. The sandwiches look decent but aren’t substantial. Since this small place doesn’t have enough seating for the few people inside, I offer the open table beside me to the couple who followed me in. They invite me to join them and so I do. We don’t talk at first because they speak Dutch. They talk back and forth as I listen quietly. She has some pink gelato and he drinks a beer. I chuckle at his jokes and after a game of charades, find out that they are leisurely travelling now that their kids are at university. They learn that I’m studying in Marseille. She calls for their check, and they get up to leave. We say our goodbyes and I stay to pass time.<br />
After wearing off my welcome, I get up to pay the man behind the glass counter. Two men (one in the front of the cafe and the other now in the back) throw some Italian across the restaurant and inform me that the couple I sat with paid for my dinner. I welcome back the 8 euros spent on the empty hostel bed I reserved.<br />
<br />
21:01<br />
I’m thinking about tomorrow morning. The only thing I have on my schedule is Mass at 8:30 at St. Peter’s Basilica. There are 12 hours until then. I’ve only just begun this long night and my eyes are aching already. I imagine the sunrise in my head, which pains my irises as if I’m actually looking at it. I get on a bus, mostly to rest. I woke up this morning at 8:00 and rushed out of the door to the airport. That was 12 hours ago. I realize that I am in the dead center, exactly where I hate to be. I cringe at the thought as it begins to lose balance. The driver mechanically steps on the gas long before I’ve made my way to the back. I catch myself and grab the dirty handrail hanging down from the roof of the bus. I sit down, noticing my reflection and the shallow bags beneath my eyes. I look at my palms. Using the public transportation here is giving me warts on my hands. It’s been 10 years since my fingers had warts on them and three are back since I’ve been in Europe.<br />
I underestimated how much happened in public at night. As if it doesn’t exist and as if nothing happens just because I’ve never spent a night alone in the dark. I realize how far-stretched, long, and sleepless tonight will be. I’m sitting on edge, under fluorescent lights, as the night only just begins. All I can think to do is ride the bus for as long as I can.<br />
The bus gets crowded. I stand for a while listening to conversations in languages I don’t speak. I am desperately far from being able to experience life through their eyes as I am outside of comprehension. Eavesdropping is a luxury I’ve long been stripped of. Although I’m around others, I can’t relate to anything that’s being said: the drama, the plans, and the nicely dressed people heading to a table set for two. I’m not a part of their world. I’m an American — a sad, barely bilingual American who is pretty far out of water, trying to take in air that’s not made for him. The bus breathes freely, however. I can feel the city’s life as the crowds fluctuate in and out. It all looks so different now, like they have privilege which magnifies my lack thereof. I feel lessened in the presence of others, as if I could stick out more than I already do.<br />
These damned curvy yellow plastic bus seats along with the cold hard interior of the bus become more and more uncomfortable over time. The form-fitting spine of the chair supports the human body at first, but after a while feels painfully unnatural. This environment was made with the worst intentions. It’s as if it was made to be as uncomfortable as possible so people like me wouldn’t want to stay. Nonetheless, I stay as long as I can because it’s a safe haven. I ride the bus until the end of its line and am kicked off in a foreign language. It’s unexpectedly over.<br />
I don’t have the words to explain desertion. I don’t know how to punctuate the gross abandonment I felt in the pit of my stomach when the engine of the bus cut. As if the fuel for the bus was the same that kept me running, I feel the engine die in the center of my chest. I descend into the cosmic black parking lot. There are two cars at the edge of the light and no other people around once the bus driver leaves. The stars above don’t mean anything and the lights of the apartment buildings shut me out. Scattered puddles mirror the speckled lights above them and ambiguate the line between the tar lot and the blacker night sky. It’s just past midnight and the mystery of everything, all at once, is multiplied by the lack of light and direction. I feel the wind and cold easily move through my jean jacket and t–shirt. The written words on signs and maps don’t make sense and I don’t know where to begin in piecing them together. My body, my head, and my heart have lost any sense of navigation here at some suburban outpost.<br />
I tell myself my name is no longer my own and that I am someone new in order to cope. I’ll do anything to disconnect myself from who I am as a protective measure (whether this is protection from myself or from someone else, I don’t know). I know, however, that I don’t want this experience attached to my name anymore because it’s turning out to be much more intimidating that I originally imagined. I don’t want to make a decision or have to pick between right or left when both equally lead to shit. I don’t want to choose, lose, and then regret not taking the other, as if it could have been better. I am no one trying to outwit reflections of myself in puddles. I try to make it to sunrise because it’s the only thing I have to look forward to. Because suddenly my home is in church and I have no other seat reserved for me. That is the only thing I have to look forward to-take me off the streets and into those walls.<br />
<br />

I walk away from homes because I fear the moment a face turns the corner in front of me. I replay a moment like this several times to desensitize myself from the fear that would course through my body. I tell myself that when it happens I need to keep my mouth closed and my eyes focused, and carefully calculate how my limbs will react. I decide between fight or flight in preparation. Apartments spread out into windy neighborhoods and my mind meticulously keeps track of everything that I see. Graffiti and grass spew through cracks in the concrete. I’m led by the road into Roman suburbia, with my hands shoved into my pockets to keep them from the cold. I clench them tightly into fists and look up at a wide street sign. Its white background bends iridescent reflections of scattered lights.<br />
My eyes lie. They speak of focus and purpose, both of which I am without. In a hyperactive state, my senses do all they can to protect me from threats. I can see behind myself when I hear engine noises and can feel lights press against my neck. I piece these hints together in my head and expect them as they approach. The lights of this on-coming car inspect me, along with the driver behind them. I clench my jaw tightly and sharpen my eyes. I fib my way through with my body language and the car moves past me, sending a shiver down my spine that causes me to stand straighter than before. I walk slower now, although I try to keep my pace up to maintain body heat. The buildings space out further and further until I see the end of the street lights quickly approaching. I stare once more into starry sky and empty earth. I continue forward, leaving the world in which I once dwelt.<br />
I am no longer affixed by the time or standards that measure days. I am now a part of a mindset without metrics, because I am only concerned for myself and for my protection. People have become opponents. I move out of time and into the spaciousness of experiences.<br />
A black car approaches me slowly, much slower than the others before. It barely rolls at my walking speed. Suddenly it is beside me. The driver even made the effort to blacken the rims and darken the windows. The light of pale faces is barely visible through the window. I look and they look too. I stare into the window. With my eyes strong and my jaw tight, I communicate one message to the man as he looks back: “I am not scared of you.” I speak the truth. He passes me, pulls a U–turn back the other way, and accelerates away from me. I don’t know where he’s decided to go or if I’ll see his return. I don’t want to find out. I pull the straps on my backpack and quickly cross the street over to the sidewalk. I cross through several alleys and resolve to find a spot to lie low for a while. Here, where nature begins to mix with residence, I come across an alcove made of hedges and neatly-kept trees between the street and someone’s home. I cross through into the backyard and, after the branches return to their stillness and the last of the leaves hit the ground, it is finally quiet again. My breathing slows down.<br />
The windows of the house are dim. I am thankful to have come across this backyard just as the houses began to get more sparse down. God, I am glad there are no dogs here because I hear them echoing across the night above me. There’s a parked car on the stone driveway that winds up a curving hill. It goes around the side of the house and away from the street that I came from. It’s perfect, but in a perfect world I wouldn’t be doing this. A small, single-wide gate crosses just in front of me with a sign hanging from it. I can’t read what it says, however. I step closer to the sign, brushing past overgrown hedgerows. There’s an icon of a video surveillance system that gets a quick reaction out of me as soon as I figure it out. I back up recklessly, making a senseless ruckus. I ask myself where it is that I plan to go. I’m not leaving. If they are home, they’re asleep; if they aren’t home, they will watch the video in the morning and I’ll be gone. Nothing’s happened so far, no alarms have gone off, and I’m not going to let a sign keep me from the best spot I’ve found all night, yet another makeshift safe haven. I’ve found my way to my room.<br />
It’s a narrow space, a kind of hall between street and yard. The worn and used path is faded to dirt. I get down on one knee, one palm on the ground and the other pressing on my knee. I pause to think about what I’m doing.<br />
I continue down to the ground. I am still wearing my backpack as I move from one knee, to sitting, to laying on my side. At first, the relief to my body is pleasant. My head rests on the back of my hands and my nose is parallel with the ground. I can see my breath mix with the dirt that it moves. The smell of dirt reminds me of when my brothers and I were younger and of how we spent long sunny days building forts in the woods. We were a team of four along with some friends, setting out with a mission to build something. We would divide tasks, collect materials, and build based on talent. We knew our positions— although the youngest brother never seemed happy with his. Someone had to do those jobs and he got over it eventually. Maybe not that day, but after sleeping it over in the night, his anger was forgotten. Time passes in remembering.<br />
The tip of my nose is getting cold. I breathe out of my mouth, into my palms cupped over my face. My left side chills against the ground. Comfortable becomes cold and colder. Minutes seem stuck in time. I shiver with the seconds. My arms are crossed and my jean jacket is buttoned up tight against my gut. The top button at the collar is open so that I can tuck my nose inside and trap heat. My muscles tighten, my legs are crookedly bent, and my feet writhe in pain.<br />
Time isn’t passing fast enough, so I close my eyes and listen. I see the cars drive by in my head once more. I feel their headlights through my skin. They speed past me as I lay on the ground in the dirt in the middle of the night.<br />
A twig cracks and frightens my eyes open. I didn’t have a choice whether or not to keep them closed. I lay still while my eyes dart quickly, looking for reason. They find nothing, and slowly and suspiciously close again. Just as my eyelashes meet in the middle, a painful probing light catches them and pulls them back. Every detail, every color, every overexposed leaf, shines in brightness. They are unnatural, unreal, and all too real at the same time. Every fold in my clothes is deepened in shadow and colored in full. I look toward the light as a car pulls into the driveway straight towards me. It’s 10 meters away and moving in my direction. I throw my head back and hide my face, trying to look like anything but a person sleeping in a corner of their yard. I tuck my feet into brush and get as still as I can. The car comes closer and the engine gets louder. The face I pictured the car having towers over me. I lie like a fool, but it sees straight through me. The shape of the car grows in ferocity and settles just past my gate to the house. The engine sputters. The two in the car step down onto the gravel and speak a language I wish I knew. They walk slowly as they make way from the car to the house. Clearer and clearer, as if they are getting closer, I can hear the thick stones being kicked around one by one. There are no voices, but the sound of feet moving. And then nothing. I think I am alone again.<br />
Time passes. I am emotionally exhausted. What seemed like a long time has only been a couple of hours. The closest thing I’ll get to sleep tonight is a sort of mix between consciousness and daze, through which I blankly lay. My mind can’t choose between one or the other, so I remain in sheer pain. My whole body shakes uncontrollably. No bigger blanket, no extra jacket, nothing else but to deal with it. The pain grows incrementally over time, until I give up. I angrily get to my feet and leave the area without looking back. With more aggression than necessary, I hit the dirt and leaves from my clothes as I walk away. I don’t know where I’m going.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I continue on, walking past the last house. I turn onto the highway leading out of the city. Morning dew condenses as I walk through the tall uncut grasses in the middle of the median. While my feet are getting soaked, I find some happiness in witnessing the formation of morning dew. I shiver and my teeth chatter. A car approaches me from behind and sounds its horn until it passes me. No doubt, the driver was trying to warn me of the dangers of walking on the highway. I see a sign for a campground and decide to make my way there. I follow the arrows. I cross the empty three–lane street and climb out of the highway, through sobbing grasses and up a steep dirt footpath. I head towards the front entrance of the camping complex and find the community washhouse. Its warm light spills out of the open doors. I pick up my pace, looking out for security, or for any sign of life. I’m not sure if this is a reasonable time to be out. I don’t belong here. I’m not paying for campsite privileges, but I’ve forgotten that they don’t know that.<br />
I quietly enter the men’s side of the washhouse and scan the building for movement. I detect none, but my footsteps echo. I want so badly to sit beneath hot water for the rest of the night but I can’t. Finding a towel, making noises, and risking blatant detachment from my belongings would make the rest of the night far more difficult than necessary. I resort to warming my body with hot water on my face and hands, then leave after using the bathroom. I hope to find some place to stay nearby to claim for the remaining hours, but I don’t see any in sight. I explore the grounds and find individual apartment buildings. I see tents, some RVs, and plenty of small European cars clustered in a distant parking lot. It’s dark and I’m not in the state of mind to build a proper mental map of this place. I am powered by intuition, looking for any place that might serve as protection. I think I’ve found what I’m looking for when I open the door of the laundry room. None of the machines are running, but it’s warm and somehow noisy. I follow the walls searching for a place to lodge myself for a few hours, but find none. I circle the room twice and notice that there’s a large frosted window and door in the room leading to an office. It’s the ground’s security office. A still blue light from a computer is suddenly blocked by a blurry body moving in the direction of the door. I leave as quickly and quietly as I can.<br />
I leave the room and go back outside. I follow the wall and hide in the shadow of the building. I watch a man leave through the same door I did, but continue straight onto the gravel. He has a flashlight in his hands but isn’t using it for some reason. I watch him turn left into a single-person apartment. I move in the opposite direction. I stumble upon a sidewalk sandwich board leaning up against one of the buildings. It’s got some drawings of pasta bowls on it. It leans on the side of the building under an awning and out of view. It’s a cluttered corner that will serve as my bed for the rest of the night. I pick up the board and unfold it so it stands on its own. I move behind it and look at the grounds. I see the laundry room and the campground office. As soon as they open up, I’m checking in, getting a shower, and sleeping. I can’t do this much longer.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
With my knees to my chest and my right shoulder against the wall of the restaurant, I close my eyes and after some time, feel my muscles lose all intention. My fingers slip and then unlock. Finally my left arm hits the sign and lands on the ground with a painfully loud thud. I tighten up again, bringing my legs back in to make sure I am as unnoticeable as possible from someone else’s perspective. The security guard’s lit flashlight passes over my corner twice. I’m not far at all from the laundromat, and therefore from his office. He must pass me in order to get to the door we shared quite some time ago. I pass through the night in a mix of psychosis and anxiety about my secrecy. I realize that if I stay here much longer than first light, I could easily be found out. I remain still, with eyes closed, not asleep, conscious and making decisions about my body position and about the dreams in my head. In and out, I can’t enjoy sleep.<br />
Time slowly passes.<br />
<br />
–:–<br />
I first hear birds chirping in my head. They pan from my left ear, to both ears, then to the right ear, but not wholly to the right because my head is resting on the brick wall. The insides of my eyelids are a shaded pale purple. I open them and see the first light of morning. The birds are real and the sky has color again. I leave the grounds and find a bus stop because the offices don’t open until 10:00. It’s 5:00. I’m not getting anymore sleep tonight and I’ve got Mass to get to at St. Peter’s. Exhausted, I make several awfully bad choices with regards to bus numbers and end up far away from the Vatican.<br />
I get off the bus about a mile up the river from my destination. With sunlight beaming down on me, I walk up toward the magnificent dome. Dark has truly made way for the most beautiful morning. My joints are aching and my muscles are relaxing, but my mind is moving much quicker than before. I notice a difference in the way I view both the streets and other people. I am different after last night. I know what it’s like to walk more than a mile in someone else’s shoes.<br />
I continue, looking up every now and then to acknowledge the morning jogger and to refocus on the growing Vatican dome.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/07/27/3-the-handmade-jewel.html">3. The Handmade Jewel (XL 1001)</a></h2>
      
      <p>27 Jul 2020</p>
      
      <p>A few days before my departure, I showed my mother the basilica in Marseille. She taught me about relics, which sent me on a seemingly elusive quest for a piece of history. It wasn’t long before history made its way to me.<br />
At this altitude, we are all a little bit closer to heaven. The ones we love and miss are only just outside of this metal tube miraculously soaring through the sky. The stewardess sees me moving my fingers through the rosary hanging around my neck, just like my mother always does before flying. She interrupts and we begin an intermittent 6-hour conversation, the kind that is built bit by bit as she walks around the plane. She spends slightly more time pouring drinks and joking with me than attending to the rest of the passengers.<br />
I notice something very admirable about her. It’s her voice. The way she speaks to others, like the German families returning to Frankfurt from vacation or the businessmen heading abroad for work, is not limited by language. She knows how to relate to each individual and builds rapport that seems effortless, for both her and for whomever she talks with. It’s as if she doesn’t think about it. She laughs with everyone and presents herself in a way that makes it easy to react, even at 4:00 in the morning.<br />
The plane is dark for the final hour of the flight. The plane’s passengers are beginning to arise out of restlessness. The stewardess quickly approaches me from behind and pushes my shoulder from the armrest. “A present for you,” she says, and places a small something in my possession. She makes no eye contact with me, although I was looking for it. She continues down the dim aisle toward the front of the plane, walks past a set of dark blue curtains, and tightly draws them after passing. I am distracted by a sense of secrecy and abnormality about her. In my palm, I find a small circular box that somehow also has corners. I want to use my light to see more clearly, but also don’t want to draw attention to the stewardess if she was in fact trying to be quiet about her present. I pull off the lid, as if it would help me see through the darkness of the cabin. I only see darkness, but the smell that comes from the inside of the box is one from my childhood. It is a spice and sweetness that collects in your throat and lingers there for a while before your body accepts its warmth as something wholly comforting. It is as familiar as walking into an old church parish. The smell is sharp, striking, and I choke a little bit, but it is ultimately beautiful, just like the rosary that lies in the box.<br />
My mind is drawn back to the final hours of my Grandmother’s life. I see her in her hospital bed surrounded by her disunified family. She’s covered in a pale blue loose-knit blanket made by her children, the kind that doesn’t protect you from the cold. I look at my young self sitting hunched over on a bench in the corner of the hospital room. I watch myself look at anything but the bed in the middle of the space and am grateful that I can’t see past the small crowd of people that surround her.<br />
I didn’t see it happen. It doesn’t matter where I am, even if I had the opportunity to see, I wouldn’t have been able to watch her die. My eyes close tightly. M y tears swim The day she died was close to the day I turned thirteen. I didn’t know how to handle the selfish side of me that just wanted a normal birthday. I was too young, too egocentric. I had never dealt with anything like this before, and the ideas I previously held of life and death never focused much on death.<br />
My innocence and my unfailing optimism left on that day and followed her. I cling to this unfortunate fact as if it is some sort of celestial proof that she and I had a relationship that was unlike those I had with rest of my family — as if it were an alibi justifying my absence from her side. It provided some meager consolation to the boy who wasn’t strong enough to hold back the tears from his eyes. I wish that I said goodbye. I wish I was strong enough to look at her and tell her that I loved her. I was the only one not there. Self-pity, loss, and change: the three threats that convinced my adolescent mind to hide high up in the clouds.<br />
Back in the sky, I decided to use the light above my head to dimly illuminate the contents of the box. The beads are a pale painted red and worn. The wood’s grain, however, is not hidden beneath the paint. The decades coil around a thick metal cross depicting a shepherd who carries a sheep over his shoulders. The smell fills the cabin and I start to notice my neighbors reacting to it. I close the lid, conceal the box in my hands, and turn off the spotlight. It is a beautiful gift – a birthday present. I feel safe and cared for.<br />
My spine shivers from these emotions that I’ve never experienced before. I write to articulate to myself how I feel. I feel here and now the undeniable existence of heaven and its relevance to our lives. I know that my Grandmother is well because the poignant scent of the rosary is the loving kiss she gave me before sending me off alone.<br />
The stewardess emerges back through the curtains, looks into my eyes, and places on my fold-down dinner table a documented relic, a piece of John Paul II’s robe. She walks away and that is the last I see of her.<br />
Her name was Edna.</p>

      <p>I am writing about the nervous thoughts in my head. After my departure was delayed a week because of visa complications, I finally have the time to refocus and muster my attention. Sometimes I forget that I am never alone. My desire for a better life pushes me to do the best that I can in the present moment. When I fail, I tear myself apart believing that I’ve sacrificed some unknown addition to the future. I have been asked to become more dependent; to piece myself together from my innately flawed humanity. I try.<br />
I ask for humility, for honesty, and for a particular openness to vulnerability: to acknowledge the past and to be present for the future. You and I are closer than I’ve ever felt before now that I’m losing all senses of familiarity. I tread lightly into the water and try to imagine emerging on top on the other side. You and I: Communion.<br />
<br />
My school, jobs, friendships, meetings, and focus all combine together in this moment. Right here, right now. I’ve worked hard to get myself into this seat. Now is not the time to let my nerves get the best of me. I am not scared, but I do question whether this is too good to be true. I am skeptical. I am jaded. I write to leave my baggage on the tarmac and I also write to pick up my few belongings in order to push the boundaries of character.</p>
