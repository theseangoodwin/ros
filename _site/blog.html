        <h2>24.&nbsp;A Reflection on Odd Numbers</h2>
        
        <p>28 Jul 2020</p>

        
        
        <p>What is it about the nature of odd or even that influences our minds? I am told to always design in odd numbers. However, we sometimes need elements to stick out, and at other times, we want to blend in, especially now in foreign territory. The holiness of the number seven is so close to the menace of six yet infinitely more superior. We try our entire lives to bridge the gap of one and many can’t. The love of three parts created a single One, to come onto Earth to demystify the path leading from one to the other. Simplicity, I fear, makes things more difficult. Knowing the odds you’re up against reveals the opposition we face. For someone like myself, that opposition often seems too large to overcome.</p>

        <p>A few days before my departure, I showed my mother the basilica in Marseille. She taught me about relics, which sent me on a seemingly elusive quest for a piece of history. It wasn’t long before history made its way to me.</p>

        <p>01 Dec 2015</p>

        
        
        <p>I am writing about the nervous thoughts in my head. After my departure was delayed a week because of visa complications, I finally have the time to refocus and muster my attention. Sometimes I forget that I am never alone. My desire for a better life pushes me to do the best that I can in the present moment. When I fail, I tear myself apart believing that I’ve sacrificed some unknown addition to the future. I have been asked to become more dependent; to piece myself together from my innately flawed humanity. I try.</p>

        <p>Why is it that I speak better French alone in my room before bed? I keep myself awake at night because I’ve gotten into the nasty habit of running through the day and its situations in my head before sleeping. Except in bed, I can quickly think of the vocabulary I forgot during the day and am able to articulate something that resembles a literate response. Whether here or there, should I not be the same regardless of location? And now that this one variable has changed, I ask myself: what value does location actually hold?</p>

        <h2>10.&nbsp;Delta: Water and <br>Numbers</h2>

        <p>Today I walk with purpose. Two days of life through a scavenger’s eyes has caused me to warmly welcome adequacy back to my side along with some new friends. I was only able to quickly stop by Camion de Snack to repay my debt to Martine and to pick up a water bottle before class. I make my way to my last class of the week, which also happens to be the first one I’ve been able to attend. Just outside the classroom, a scattered student mass begins to gather, waiting for the room to be available. Now is the first time that I’ve had a real chance to observe the smartly dressed and put-together typecast that is the French student body. Ladies and gentlemen, they care about the way they look. No ‘comfy’ clothes for lounging in lecture halls here. Dudes are wearing fitted slacks, tees, and the classic euro side-bags, while the women are completely blowing the American girls out of the water. Absolutely beautiful. And even more beautiful is the way they carry themselves. I turn to a relatably styled classmate next to me and introduce myself. She is tall, has mysterious eyes, and the persona to match. She is from Canada so of course I am the one who breaks the French a couple of moments into the conversation. She has an air about her that I wholeheartedly respect. Something like a subdued congeniality that asks me to appreciate the smallest details of her mannerisms. Her smile is honest and tells me that she appreciates our time together. Her name is Cynthia and I appreciated our time together as well.</p>
