        <p>“My face is shining upon you, beaming out peace that transcends your feeble understanding. A sea of problems surrounds you, but you are face to face with Me, your peace. As long as you focus on me, you are safe. If you gaze too long at the myriad problems around you, you will sink under the weight of your burdens. 
The closer you live to Me, the safer you are. Circumstances around you are undulating, and there are treacherous-looking waves in the distance. Fix your eyes on Me, because I never change. By the time those waves reach you, they will have shrunk to the proportions of My design. I am always beside you, helping you face today’s waves. The future is a phantom.”</p>

        <h2>28.&nbsp;28. Avignon: Near Glass Houses</h2>
        
        <p>13 Dec 2020</p>

        
        
        <p>I spent the second half of the day with new people. I’m a young American armed with a camera who relies on charisma and spontaneity. One photo-op that I couldn’t pass up resulted in my meeting Morgan and Bolgarov right outside of the city walls. They were on their bikes in front of the stone city ramparts. I saw them marking up the garden terraces and modern cement underpass near the highway. They welcomed my camera and my simple French.</p>

        <p>13 Dec 2020</p>

        
        
        <p>Just when I begin to feel in control, You bring me here and remind me of my place. I sit at the back of this space against the wall on the bench made for people like me. My eyes move through the emptiness before my feet, filling in the floor as it would have been 800 years ago. My senses are intrigued by the deep colors and glimmering gold, the smell, the sun sifting through the stained glass and dusty air, the fabrics and feel of the hundreds of holy vestments. I look at myself. Who would I have been? Could I have made it here in this building? Is this someplace I would even want to be? The contingency of another lifetime leaves me only with questions. I see the crowds of people who are truly holier than I lined towards the altar. I see the bishops, cardinals, and then the Pope at this time, Benedict XIII. I hear choirs singing praises to the heavens. How many of them acknowledge and appreciate the blessing they’ve been given? Music changes hearts, and yet the mouths the voices come from sometimes leave their own unchanged. I see design, hierarchy, and human next to human piecing together one body. This is one body built from many, and I no longer wonder where my part is in it. I am small. I am an outsider here, an observer to some extent. I watch and I see through the crowd. Their bodies no longer affect my experience, for this room holds only space now. I see You at the front and myself at the back.</p>

        <p>I begin at the bottom. I look at the things around me, the people I am with. I love them. These circumstances are all that I know and they are not the best. I want something better. I move myself. I am only a man. I am only human. Moving mountains is a daunting task, but I will try. I must because I realize that I will live, I will get attached, I will misstep, I will change, and then I will die. There needs to be something that I look back on and am proud of having built, even if this is some artificial and flawed mountain made by my hands. In the likeness of the mountains our God put on earth, I am pleased to imagine another generation tearing my mountains down in order to build their own in their place. The reality is that nothing has been guaranteed to me or to any of us. This body will fail, my heart will stop, and while I can desire heaven all I want, desire alone is not enough to obtain it. It must be a combination of all three critical parts of me. Body, heart, and mind are pivotal in putting the immaterial within my reach. I have only one chance to make it to my goal, so there is no time to waste.</p>

        <p>What is it about the nature of odd or even that influences our minds? I am told to always design in odd numbers. However, we sometimes need elements to stick out, and at other times, we want to blend in, especially now in foreign territory. The holiness of the number seven is so close to the menace of six yet infinitely more superior. We try our entire lives to bridge the gap of one and many can’t. The love of three parts created a single One, to come onto Earth to demystify the path leading from one to the other. Simplicity, I fear, makes things more difficult. Knowing the odds you’re up against reveals the opposition we face. For someone like myself, that opposition often seems too large to overcome.</p>

It is dusk on the third Thursday that I’ve been here in France. The overcast sky and watery streets creep into the cracked church and dampen the walls. Since they cannot force their way in entirely, I imagine this is the most dreary ambiance they can muster. The dominant colors around me are black and blue and stone gray. The chill and hollow empty space are causing the church to be blustery and cold. I kneel on the smooth rounded bar at my feet and let the discomfort in my bones distract the rest of my body from the cold. I reflect on the days that have passed.</p>

        <p>When I walked into my room last night, I found that all my posters had fallen to the ground. I am so out of my element that even the particles of paint are trying to tell me so. As if I had forgotten that the most simple aspects of my home culture have been taken from me. As if I could forget where I am. Shame on me for trying to make these walls feel a bit more like home. These things around me fall down and so I reach down and re-secure them with care.</p>

        <p>The French language is not some club to be held in an exclusive manner. The popular perspective claiming that French should only be spoken perfectly creates insurmountable barriers for those without fluency. I live in a country where I am not fluent in the dominant language and have to address this confusing mental block in order to survive. I hope others facing similar hurdles do the same.</p>

        <p>Sunday comes with remarkable beauty. I make my way to the port and eat at my new favorite restaurant: Au Vieux Port. I can’t resist the simplicity of enjoying good food while looking out to the Mediterranean morning of Marseille. In celebration of the sublime, I welcome the finer breads, cheeses, meats, and vegetables into my life: my truest friends. Thinly-sliced saussison, mozzarella, and tomato, topped with salt, pepper, and arguably the most enticing house-mixed olive oil I’ve ever had. Beside the plate lies thick and fresh whole-grain, perfectly crunchy bread with a thin spread of silky smooth butter. Arugula, olives, and brie cheese are on the other side of the plate topped with the restaurant’s olive oil and some thick balsamic vinegar.</p>

        <p>I give and I take. I am not selfish. I am certainly not selfless. In the end, however, we are all some combination of both. Our presence in a space is a contribution to it as a whole. Whether we give ourselves to the moment and its potential glory or else shy away as a recluse is an argument, a conversation, which we can only introspectively conduct.</p>

        <p>Why is it that I speak better French alone in my room before bed? I keep myself awake at night because I’ve gotten into the nasty habit of running through the day and its situations in my head before sleeping. Except in bed, I can quickly think of the vocabulary I forgot during the day and am able to articulate something that resembles a literate response. Whether here or there, should I not be the same regardless of location? And now that this one variable has changed, I ask myself: what value does location actually hold?</p>

        <p>Today I walk with purpose. Two days of life through a scavenger’s eyes has caused me to warmly welcome adequacy back to my side along with some new friends. I was only able to quickly stop by Camion de Snack to repay my debt to Martine and to pick up a water bottle before class. I make my way to my last class of the week, which also happens to be the first one I’ve been able to attend. Just outside the classroom, a scattered student mass begins to gather, waiting for the room to be available. Now is the first time that I’ve had a real chance to observe the smartly dressed and put-together typecast that is the French student body. Ladies and gentlemen, they care about the way they look. No ‘comfy’ clothes for lounging in lecture halls here. Dudes are wearing fitted slacks, tees, and the classic euro side-bags, while the women are completely blowing the American girls out of the water. Absolutely beautiful. And even more beautiful is the way they carry themselves. I turn to a relatably styled classmate next to me and introduce myself. She is tall, has mysterious eyes, and the persona to match. She is from Canada so of course I am the one who breaks the French a couple of moments into the conversation. She has an air about her that I wholeheartedly respect. Something like a subdued congeniality that asks me to appreciate the smallest details of her mannerisms. Her smile is honest and tells me that she appreciates our time together. Her name is Cynthia and I appreciated our time together as well.</p>

        <p>The hardest part is arriving, now I am finally here. I’ve worked diligently to make my own way to this country and now it is reciprocating back to me. It has given me a part of itself to call my own, it makes me feel safe, and it allows me to recover after I’ve given the day all I have. While there undoubtedly are things around me that will fall apart, I now know that even the space above my bed is helping me to build my dreams.</p>

        <p>Martine speaks English. This is good. She also owns a food truck. This is very good. After we are introduced, the park official explains my situation. She hops out of the back of her truck, yells in beautiful French at the man behind the grill (her husband), and agrees to help. I thank my new friend the park official, and continue down the hill with Martine.</p>

<p>She is a friendly woman, very likeable and spunky. Physically, she has a medium height and short black hair, with blonde dyed sections. Her eyes command so much attention that her large, bright red, square frame glasses do not hinder their effect. We chat as best as we can. I, again, talk about where I came from, but this time I fill in the gaping holes of my French with English substitutes. I got a big reaction from her when I told her I arrived in the city only hours ago. We get to the gate of the apartment complex, which is locked thanks to the French lunch hour (I’d later learn that “hour” really means “two hours”). It seems that there is no office here that ‘works through lunch’. I appreciate the French commitment to food.</p>

        <p>After making several disjointed inquiries about transportation, I finally arrive on campus. I realize that when I say, ‘I arrive on campus,’ it sounds like I know what I’m doing and where I’m heading now that I’ve come. This is just not true. American colleges and French colleges are very different. America is different than France. Streets, cars,maps, the way you get out of the metro, the signs and the symbols and the colors are jarringly different in France than they are in the United States of America. These vibrant reminders, coupled with the fact that I’ve been travelling for over 20 hours, are proving to be an absolutely wonderful challenge.</p>
