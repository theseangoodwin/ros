                        <div class="content_div"><p>Tyler Durdon called it when he looked to camera in Fight Club and said, “You’re not your fuckin’ khakis.” Gone are the days of the monolith and blind consumerism. In order to make it now, brands need clarity to navigate new complexity in the world as well as creativity to be the change customers want to see in it.\</p>

<p>Clarity has always been an important part of a brand’s success, it’s just evolved with time. In the 50’s Volvo marketed safety– and that’s it. The only thing you had to do to sell those cars was write some copy about safety, put the logo in the bottom corner, and then families with young kids would buy that brand of car over others. The important part is that Volvo knew safety was their schtick.\</p>

<p>In the 80’s and 90’s new technologies became viable for business, we saw an increased importance of data to support marketing claims, the whole dot com mess happened, and then trailblazers like Amazon, Wegmans, and Southwest started customizing brand experiences for more and more specific segments of consumers. With consumer’s demand for specificity came a need for greater detail in the brand’s identity. That means more articulate advertisements and a more flexible identity system.\</p>

<p>We’re at a point now where the market runs rampant with digital natives. Companies like Warby Parker, Casper, and Blue Apron prove it’s possible to replace in-person brand touchpoints with entirely digital ones. This opportunity requires next-gen clarity in order to navigate the evolving digital landscape.\</p>

<p>Clarity empowers brands to express themselves instinctually. It, much like our own personalities, informs how and why we respond to the world. A brand with a high level of clarity does not get bogged down in discerning how to present itself across platforms, it just does. The brand is able to tailor touchpoints to drive core values and tell compelling stories. This leads to why companies need creativity.\</p>

<p>Creativity is needed to break through the noise. In the market today that means competing on social values and social media. Companies that are confident in their core pillars, tone of voice, and visual identity are able to multiply their impact through their customer-base. By entrusting communities with a company’s brand, the two parties are able to drive the change they want to see in the world and win on loyalty. Companies that compete on these social values garner success and greater relevance against competitors.\</p>

<p>The Ben and Jerry’s business manifesto is founded on social values. When George Floyd was murdered the company responded and offered its platform to the Black Lives Matter movement. To combat criticism, the company cited archives of their practiced approach of supporting the company’s core beliefs. Based on that exchange and prevailing customer-centrism in business today, it’s evident that companies will be expected to no longer just be bystanders. It is expected that they be active partners in social change.\</p>

<p>Key to community-driven social change is the elasticity of a company’s brand. Elasticity demands clarity as a prerequisite and relies on creativity to act on happenstance. For better or worse, no one really wants to hear a blank recitation of core beliefs and tweets saying, “I told you so.” The value for both companies and society is derived from the creativity with which a statement is made. Campaigns, for lack of a better word, like Ben and Jerry’s presents a more heartening, more dimensional perception of the company.\</p>

<p>I think of Ben and Jerry’s, Bezos, Gates, and Musk as leaders in this change. They all are public figures who serve as figureheads for the company. It feels natural for them to lead the way in this evolution of brand. I’m interested to see how brands change in this way without literally personifying their company to the market. Then again, maybe there is some sort of Philip K. Dick science-fiction future with brand androids living and socializing with humans….\</p>

<p>Clarity is needed to navigate the evolving business landscape of the world today. Creativity is needed to break through the noise and sell the message. For the time being, these two words humanize our understanding of what it means to be a company in the world today.</p>

    <h4 class="location">Marseille City Center</h4>
</div>   
                        <div class="content_div"><p>Vacation has nothing to do with location. It’s a state of mind that I’ve been fooled by. Placebic palm fronds and a sea of new faces have done a number on my mind. I’ve fallen victim to the mirage of an empty schedule and, as if I’m crawling out of the desert searching for water, I’m craving to be alone. For the entirety of February I’ve been making my way from bus, to city, to hostel, to dinner party, to bar, to bed, to an early rise, to food, and then repeat all with a slew of new people. Now, at the beginning of Lent, I pardon myself from my own pressures to continue where I left myself off.\</p>

<p>I’ve committed these next few days to more intimately understand my relationship with Marseille. The city and people has welcomed me so warmly, and yet every chance I’ve had, I left to go to some other place. I owe it some level of attention and I get the feeling it’s been keeping so many things from me to discover. I’ve got this pearly city at my fingertips, yet I ignored it because of the familiarity of the word ‘home.’\</p>

<p>It’s true, I’ve been entranced by the magic of food markets, French history, and the charismatic back streets in every city I’ve been in except for Marseille. The second largest city in France surely has these and more, but I’ve just been distracted from truly experiencing them.\</p>

<p>I make the largest meal of the day, breakfast, (which has more dinner foods than breakfast foods) and commit to fasting for the rest of the day. I leave the apartment with only my camera in my backpack and spend the morning making my way through the art district which occupies the space between the Saint Charles train station and the port. I collect some rad carrots with a huge bundle of leafy green tops from the open-air shelves. Making my way inside the storefront where all the fruits are laid out, I find one of the owners hunched over an EDF electricity bill in front of the olive containers. Then an employee’s voice comes from the back room and offers to check me out at the register. I’m the only customer in the store. At the register, there are some bananas that are lumped into my purchase, but I’m still not sure how, but I think God made it happen for a reason. I shrug it off and I paid the extra euro and change.\</p>

<p>I excitedly come across a boucherie and step into the store, but not for meat necessarily. I pointedly search through the long glass cases and quickly pass the birds, pork, and beef. Although they look great, I was already given a banana by God. In the back where the unpopular items are, I find my prize: a sheep’s head. Five of them, actually, each for five euros. The skull is my trophy and finding it for this price is much better than I expected. A cleaned, prepped skull back home can sell for more than $50. (Side note, my entire transaction here was in French again; it’s good to be out of Spain.) He offers to cut the skull in half for me, to access the brain to eat. Quickly, and with a bit of fear in my voice, I tell him no. I consider the uselessness of a halved skull in my collection. He wraps the head and passes it to me over the glass display. I smile and skip to the register, a twinkle in my eye. I step down into the foot-path intersection just outside of the store and shade my eyes with my free hand.\</p>

<p>My life suddenly is soundtracked by dopey synthesizers and vibrant primary colors as I spin, holding the head in both hands out in front of me. The smiley sun shines on the dancing tulips below. The growing patterns of tulips are irrelevant here in my shroom-like euphoria. Grinning like a twelve-year-old, I’m happy on a beautiful French afternoon. This excitement is so familiar and so different. Familiar because I think of Virginia and the rest of my bone collection, but different because I’ve got something to show for my venture out here to France. Marseille has officially made its way into the collection, like it belongs there and is officially a part of me. My interests and collections are part of me and the city has a place in my biography as well. I want to go home right now and begin cleaning the skull, but it’s only 13:00 and I remember my commitment to exploring Marseille today. I continue.\</p>

<p>After I come down from my collector’s high, I put the head in my backpack and make my way downtown. On my way to wherever I am heading, I pass an intriguing pair of men living on the street. They are wearing high-laced boots, tattered fitted jeans, and embody indelible swagger. I don’t mean to be anything but honest here, but the piercings on their faces, the studs on their dingy leather jackets, and the hollow pins jammed through their hats made them look like friends already. “Bonjour Monsieur,” the one on the right happily offers. I look, nod, and smile. I pass and realize that I just found how I’ll spend the rest of the day.</p>

</div>   
                        <div class="content_div"><p>I make my way through a grocery store collecting drinks, oranges, saussison, and pain au chocolate for the two homeless men I passed. As I’m writing this, I realize that I’ve picked out the foods I would have really liked to have eaten, which I’m sure has some metaphorical value. When I grab them quickly off the shelves, I recall my fast. I realize why I’ve been given that extra bunch of bananas as well. I put everything in one plastic bag and carry two large drinks in my hands. I put my camera away, fighting the temptation to capture their look in photograph. Two years of social justice education at my university has taught me to be especially intentional in situations like this. I am no savior. I return to their place and offer what I’ve brought.</p>

<p>Unsure of what language to begin in, I goofily hop between French and English and am relieved when English is fluently spoken back. When I eventually sit down with them on the concrete, I am careful to present myself as authentically as I can. I am not nervous because of them; I’m nervous because there is a gross stigma about people that live on the streets. It’s a barrier that puts them in a terrible light, as if they are some underground population of alter-races. I do my best to avoid these ideas as the conversation begins.</p>

<p>Ed, the more extroverted of the two, is the first to welcome me. His German face has over a thousand intricacies that tell the story of a lifetime. There is a scar or a deep wrinkle (I can’t quite tell which) on his skin that runs laterally across his face. His right nostril is pierced and he has ink just beneath his cheek skin in some befuddled shape that lost its corners with time. Both ears are crudely pierced and the stretched lobe on the left side has been torn from a fist fight. He tells me that a shark bone used to hang there from when he was fishing for sharks in Florida. Push came to shove, and he lost his job there nearly 11 years ago. When he was unemployed, he crossed the U.S. by foot in four and a half years. His wiry red beard thinly fills his face and his laugh is more of an alarming cackle. I’m not sure how the laugh came to sound that way over the years, but it seems as if it has taken time and intentionality to perfect. I never thought this laugh existed outside of TV.</p>

<p>Danny, the blued-eyed Dutchman, looks like God. The triangle made from his eyes and the metal bar that runs through the bridge of his nose makes the clearest window to divinity I’ve ever seen. In this moment, I begin to think about the differences between circumstance and divine intervention. For the first hour he quietly stayed back against the wall, watching the two of us. There is a bottle of red wine close to his side along with the new sack of foods I brought in the corner behind him. He just existed. Some makeshift metal rings buried in his facial hair ran through his nose and bottom lip, which I didn’t notice at first. Brown-blond hair falls to the side beneath the brim of his hat. He is dark, shady, and very selective with what he’s said to me so far. He speaks his mother tongue, along with French, English, Portuguese, German, and soon Italian. The two of them have plans to migrate to Italy by the end of the year. Danny offers me wine from their bottle and a cigarette. I deny both. He asks two young ladies passing by for a cigarette. They initially declined and continued past us, but then returned moments later with two cigarettes. One to share, and one to save.</p>

<p>“And you don’t smoke?” Ed asks again. 
“No,” I respond. 
“Good,” he says. “Don’t start.” 
“Unless you don’t like who you are,” Danny calmly chimes in.</p>

<p>Ed finishes his thought, “Waking up in the morning without cigarettes is worse than dying. Your body collapses on itself during the night. Like oysters clinging to your insides, they grind up against you and you can’t breathe until you smoke two or three and hack the shit up.” 
“A fucking bastard drug that changes who you are.” 
…
“You play chess?”</p>

<p>And so Ed and I begin our game. He carefully lifts a tiny plastic chessboard from his possessions and sets it between us. I notice that the black set is missing a knight that has been replaced by one of his teeth. It’s rounded and worn, with a silver filling in the cavity. This set is placed in front of him and the white set is initially placed closer to me. He picks a piece from each side, closes his fists, and mixes them. He then holds his outstretched arms out before me. I touch his right hand to reveal a black piece in his palm. He rotates the board and gives me the black pieces and the tooth.</p>

<p>When the game begins, I get a feel for what I am up against. Ed is a smart, forward-thinking strategist that knows how to prepare for the future. His finger twitches as he counts out the moves I will eventually make. I know the game is in his hands for the majority of the time, but I try not to let him know that. As the game progresses, there is a short period where the control shifts from his side to mine, but eventually moves back to his. I become less focused and lose my confidence in chess. I get distracted and pay more attention to the situation. This hour of quiet introspection hunched over the board is familiar and easy. I find comfort on the ground in Marseille watching the people pass by, towering above us. 
He makes a huge diagonal move from across the board and takes a key rook of mine. I disappointedly exhale. “It’s still the same game!” Danny adds, looking at me like a father or a coach. I feel cared for. The oceanfront wind moves through the buildings like a wind tunnel. Exposed and stripped of measure, I feel solidarity between strangers and have found value in this uncommon situation.</p>

<p>I look back down to the board and continue to make moves. A calculated “check” falls from Ed’s mouth. “It’s over, but we’re going to play until the bloody end.” And we do. We play until I lose. Grins turn up on our faces. I shake Ed’s hand and admit to defeat in a well - deserved victory.</p>

<p>Two young French girls pass by and ask if we are brothers. “To some extent, yea.”</p>

</div>   
                        <div class="content_div"><p>I’m conflicted. I often don’t like myself as a person and today happens to be one of those mornings when I wish there was much more room between me and myself. \</p>

<p>The most beautiful morning emerges from beyond the horizon. The pastel gradient sky touches pale lavender, red, yellow, and green, before spreading across in the most abundant blue. Clouds mix with contrails and compose empty space. These orange strokes are complementary to the water and earth. The scene is a blurry picture that rushes past me. Although the day is still in the making and it may be too early to tell, it is good. Did nature decide this, or did I? \</p>

<p>The iron tracks hug the coast. We pass small tucked-in villages with cubed buildings that soak in the sun. I imagine that landscapes such as these are the source of inspiration for realist oil-painters. Renoir, Bonheur, Courbet, and the likes come to mind. Shadows are blue, not black, and they allow for subtle cracks and textures in the shaded areas to remain visible. This blue fills in the sides not lucky enough to feel the rising sun. \</p>

<p>I let the colors into my eyes and realize that beauty does not merely exist in immensely complex and arduous works. Beauty may be simple and often times it is. It can be an accident. When a community comes together, it rarely happens all at one time or with one final product in mind. Construction can be entirely serendipitous. These buildings were made one after another as a means to an end. There are lessons to be learned from the homes that cluster in the crests of the rolling terrain, or the chapel with a pointed steeple adorning the top of the highest point. The little villages quietly command attention as we pass. They are either too small or we are moving too fast. We pass so quickly that these thoughts are written from brief memories. The train comes up on more elaborate constructions.\</p>

<p>Big businesses, industrial parks, and factories smog up the sky. You can’t see the pollution once the smoke assimilates into the rest of the blue, but it’s there. I know that the air above the polluting smokestacks is changing for the worse once the gray fades and separates. Rusty gray pylons and conveyor belts hang around like broken appendages. Limp and lifeless, they bend at the whim of their designers. Beauty has been co-opted for the sake of productivity and efficiency. The factory is one body built to serve a single purpose. Is that beautiful too?\</p>

<p>There is a parking lot, but it is empty. What’s going on inside the factory while no one is there? This industrialized view, unfortunately, stays around for much longer than the small villages. We move and it moves with us, dragging behind and begging for attention. \</p>

<p>We escape it when my window turns black. Beneath cement and earth, we duck down and leave the factory behind.</p>

Montpellier is a small city that has both preserved its history and radically adopted new technology. The tramline peeks in and out of concrete plazas and the mirrored glass facades of 21st century buildings extenuate and reanimate the past life of stone buildings. For now, I celebrate alone. This is a toast dedicated to the days spent for myself. I try to ignore my throbbing hip and cool my scratchy throat by drinking from a seltzer water bottle refilled with still water. I’ve claimed a bench overlooking the artificially green Lez River below. My rented bike is on the kickstand behind me and I unwrap an icy blue cough drop from its aluminum tray. Funnily enough, these have been a few moments which I’ve enjoyed most.</p>

<p>I want to be able to ask, “How did I get so lucky?” but I know that luck has nothing to do with it. I know exactly how I got to be where I am right now.</p>

A bankrupt soul for a happy heart? Can’t the two coexist? Isn’t it possible for black and white to create balance, repetition, movement, scale, and beauty? My insides aren’t any different than others’. At least they shouldn’t be.</p>

<p>I open myself up, take a blade deep into my fat stomach and pull it across. It is a division that becomes gaping insight to the things that make me. I stare down past my chest and watch a gray curdled mush slowly spill out and into my lap.</p>

Just because I think that Marketing and Graphic Design go hand in hand does not mean that they actually do or will. I don’t foresee myself being happy at the start of my career because of the expectations employers have of recent graduates. This cross compatibility sounds great in my head, but I can’t see the path I will take out into the real world.\</p>

<p>Conscientiousness does not equate to clarity. Just because I tell myself with conviction that success will come doesn’t mean that I am anywhere close to seeing that goal through. Even in the right place under the light of the right idea, the future professional I want to become can’t tell me what to do. For all I know, I could have bought a ticket way up at the top of the theatre and wouldn’t be able to see through the silhouettes in front of me.</p>

I am astounded as I peer over the edge into the black and my insides collapse. I realize that there is some capacity for my imagination to make up the dimensions of the hole, but imagination spawns from truth. This truth lies in the similarities between my days and those of the impoverished. The only difference between tourism and homelessness is the amount of money in your pocket.</p>

<p>I arrive in a city, take to the streets, and am eager to experience the day for what it is worth. I am look forward to solving the problems that come my way. I step down from the train, the bus, the plane, the whatever, and the sun is always shining. I venture to the hostel and for a period of time I am lost. I have a map, but I am by no means found. I do not know where exactly I will sleep tonight, but I know that there is a place reserved for me. This feeling of certainty is the fine line between the two occupations of time. It is this sample of unsurety that allows me to know the complications that come through doing nothing.</p>

<p>How can I better understand life on the streets than to put myself there? I envisioned myself asleep on the ground. I seek clarity for these visions because ambiguity makes me uncomfortable. I seek the innocence of the dove and the wisdom of the wolf.</p>

                        <div class="content_div"><p>London has gone dry despite the weather and I shrink. I hoped that this trip would be a source of inspiration, but I find none here. The throngs of people and drinks create semi-reflective conversations, but they are shallow and quickly drain. I can hardly keep my thoughts.</p>

<p>I look over my shoulder to see the rain drizzling down from the gray evening sky. It’s not a heavy rain; it’s light and a bit refreshing. I stop moving in order to take in the scene and let the water drip from my lashes to obscure the commotion of the streets. The mediocre advertisements, neon signs, headlights, vibrant refractions of red double-decker buses, cellphones, and police flashers spread out before me as I squint my eyes. They create a collage that moves in real time. 
My eyes let in more light when I relax my pupils. I allow the objects to fall further from focus in order to let their shapes grow larger and larger. Slowly, inspiration blooms.</p>

<p>I balance between the blurriness and my mind’s desire to understand the details. The colors are free of form and my mind can’t stand it. Suddenly, a final set of headlights turn the corner closest to me and painfully enter through my eyes. I tightly close them and rub my face.</p>

<p>Turning back, I tighten my backpack and catch up to the group.</p>

                        <div class="content_div"><p>I believe that creativity is not reserved for who we typically call the ‘creative’. Creativity is not related to skill. It is not related to passion or only the aesthetic value of a thing. \</p>

<p>My definition of creativity has largely been formed by the work of Brené Brown, a social psychologist and researcher. In 2013, Brown offered the following statement: Vulnerability is the birthplace of creativity, innovation, and change. And derived from that is my working definition of creativity: Creativity is the combination of vulnerability, a medium, and action.\</p>

<p>Creativity describes the transformation of an idea to an outcome. The process assumes the vulnerability of the maker and bravery in offering something via some medium to the world. That offering, be it performance, physical art, a thesis, a political platform, or business strategy etc., will take some form and be critiqued by its audience. If not by others, then certainly by the maker themself. The point being, that where there was once nothing, a person took it upon themself to make something—creation.</p>
