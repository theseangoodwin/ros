After my departure was delayed a week because of visa complications, I finally have the time to refocus and muster my attention. Sometimes I forget that I’m not going this alone. My desire for a better life pushes me to do the best that I can in the present moment. When I fail, I tear myself apart believing that I’ve sacrificed some unknown addition to the future. I have been asked to become more dependent; to piece myself together from my innately flawed humanity.<br />
<br />
I ask for humility, for honesty, and for a particular openness to vulnerability: to acknowledge the past and to be present for the future. We’re closer than I’ve ever felt before now that I’m losing all senses of familiarity. I tread lightly into the water and try to imagine emerging on top on the other side. <br />
<span class="blackletter">We commune</span>. <br />
My work, school, jobs, friendships, meetings, and focus all combine together in this moment. Right here, right now as I board the flight. I’ve worked hard to get myself into this seat. Now is not the time to let my nerves get the best of me. I am not scared, but I do question whether this is too good to be true. I am skeptical. I write to leave my baggage on the tarmac and I also write to pick up my few belongings in order to push the boundaries of character.\</p>

</div>   
                    
                    <div class="content_div"><p>A few days before my departure, I showed my mother the basilica in Marseille. She taught me about Christian relics, which sent me on a seemingly elusive quest for a piece of history. It wasn’t long before history made its way to me.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>At this altitude, we are all a little bit closer to heaven. The ones we love and miss are only just outside of this metal tube miraculously soaring through the sky. The stewardess sees me moving my fingers through the rosary hanging around my neck, just like my mother always does before flying. She interrupts and we begin an intermittent 6-hour conversation, the kind that is built bit by bit as she walks around the plane. She spends slightly more time pouring drinks and joking with me than attending to the rest of the passengers.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>I notice something very admirable about her. It’s her voice. The way she speaks to others, like the German families returning to Frankfurt from vacation or the businessmen heading abroad for work, is not limited by language. She knows how to relate to each individual and builds rapport that seems effortless, for both her and for whomever she talks with. It’s as if she doesn’t think about it. She laughs with everyone and presents herself in a way that makes it easy to react, even at 4:00 in the morning.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>The plane is dark for the final hour of the flight. The plane’s passengers are beginning to arise out of restlessness. The stewardess briskly approaches me from behind and pushes my shoulder from the armrest. “A present for you,” she says, and places a small something in my possession. She makes no eye contact with me, although I was looking for it. She continues down the dim aisle toward the front of the plane, walks past a set of dark blue curtains, and tightly draws them after passing. I am distracted by a sense of secrecy and abnormality about her.</p>

<p><br />
In my palm, I find a small circular box that somehow also has corners. I want to use my light to see more clearly, but also don’t want to draw attention to the stewardess if she was in fact trying to be quiet about her present. I pull off the lid, as if it would help me see through the darkness of the cabin. I only see darkness, but the smell that comes from the inside of the box is one from my childhood. It is a spice and sweetness that collects in your throat and lingers there for a while before your body accepts its warmth as something wholly comforting. It is as familiar as walking into an old church parish. The smell is sharp, striking, and I choke a little bit, but it is ultimately beautiful, just like the rosary that lies in the box.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>My mind is drawn back to the final hours of my Grandmother’s life. I see her in her hospital bed surrounded by her disunified family. She’s covered in a pale blue loose-knit blanket made by her children, the kind that doesn’t protect you from the cold. I look at my young self sitting hunched over on a bench in the corner of the hospital room. I watch myself look at anything but the bed in the middle of the space and am grateful that I can’t see past the small crowd of people that surround her.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>I didn’t see it happen. It doesn’t matter where I am, even if I had the opportunity to see, I wouldn’t have been able to watch her die. My eyes close tightly. My tears swim The day she died was close to the day I turned thirteen. I didn’t know how to handle the selfish side of me that just wanted a normal birthday. I was too young, too egocentric. I had never dealt with anything like this before, and the</p>

<blockquote>
ideas I previously held of <span class="blackletter">life</span> and death never focused much on <span class="blackletter">death.</span>
<button onclick="addClass()" class="interaction-box-inline"><a></a></button></blockquote>

<p><br />
My innocence and my unfailing optimism left on that day and followed her. I cling to this unfortunate fact as if it is some sort of celestial proof that she and I had a relationship that was unlike those I had with rest of my family — as if it were an alibi justifying my absence from her side. It provided some meager consolation to the boy who wasn’t strong enough to hold back the tears from his eyes. I wish that I said goodbye. I wish I was strong enough to look at her and tell her that I loved her. I was the only one not there. Self-pity, loss, and change: the three threats that convinced my adolescent mind to hide high up in the clouds.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>Back in the sky, I decided to use the light above my head to dimly illuminate the contents of the box. The beads are a pale painted red and worn. The wood’s grain, however, is not hidden beneath the paint. The decades coil around a thick metal crucifix. The smell fills the cabin and I start to notice my neighbors reacting to it. I close the lid, conceal the box in my hands, and turn off the spotlight. It is a beautiful gift – a birthday present. I feel safe and cared for.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>My spine shivers in response to these thoughts I’ve avoided for years. I write to articulate coincedence to myself how I feel. I feel here and now the undeniable existence of heaven and its relevance to our lives. I know that my Grandmother is well because the poignant scent of the rosary is the loving kiss she gave me before sending me off alone.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>The stewardess emerges back through the curtains, looks into my eyes, and places on my fold-down dinner table a documented relic, a piece of John Paul II’s robe. She walks away and that is the last I see of her. Her name was Edna.</p>

“We have twenty-five minutes until we land,” I hear the stewardess speak into the overhead. I listen for directions to my transfer, put my pen down, and begin to organize my things.</p>

<p><br />
American colleges and French colleges are very different. America is different than France. Streets, cars, maps, the way you get out of the metro, the signs and the symbols and the colors are jarringly different here than they are back home. These vibrant reminders, coupled with the fact that I’ve been travelling for over 20 hours, are proving to be an wonderful challenge.</p>

<p><br />
While I have nevertheless arrived, I am not in any shape to make my flat contract meeting, let alone any of my classes for the day. I have with me my duffle bag with silly little wheels (~30 pounds), my carry-on bag with my documentation and electronics (~10 pounds), and a profoundly abstract campus city map (useless). So, I wander.</p>

<p><br />
Initially, I stayed with the student group that got off the bus. After climbing a steep slope, rocky path, and some stairs, I soon realized that I made the wrong decision. Maybe a quarter of those on the bus were attending my University, but they headed in the opposite direction. So, I suppose shame on me for following the crowd.</p>

<p><br />
For a while, I wondered in intense internal conversation. I was frustrated that I couldn’t interpret the signs or confidently ask for directions. I swallowed my pride and decided to talk to the first uniformed or suited person I could find. Since there were a number of questionable fashion choices and misleading uses of blazers, I decided to tighten up my parameters. The person that I would ask needed to be about 30 years old, had a full suit on, and, for added legitimacy, should be holding a briefcase.</p>

This person came in the form of a security guard that didn’t really meet any of my criteria. He worked for Les Calanques Nature Park at the edge of campus. I read about this place before I left for France but had no idea it would be so close to where I would be going to school. I told him that I was looking for the address written on a piece of paper that I pulled out from my carry-on bag. Unfortunately, he didn’t recognize the address and didn’t really speak English. I, even after 4 years of high school language classes, surely will not say that I speak French.</p>

<p><br />
Our conversation quickly transformed into a hilarious dance about ourselves. We “talked” about where I came from, the time of my arrival, and laughed together. I think at one point he said that he flew airplanes. I’m not quite sure, but he did stretch out his arms, point his fingers, and tilt his body as if that had something to do with flying. We walked down the hill for a while as he tried to find someone for me to speak English with. It was then that I was introduced to Martine.</p>

                    <div class="content_div"><p>Martine speaks English. This is good. <a>She also owns a food truck.</a> This is better. After we are introduced, the park official explains my situation. She hops out of the back of her truck, yells in beautiful French at the man behind the grill (her husband), and agrees to help. I thank my new friend the park official, and continue down the hill with Martine.</p>

<p><br />
She is a friendly woman, very likeable and spunky. Physically, she has a medium height and short black hair, with blonde dyed sections. Her eyes command so much attention that her large, bright red, square frame glasses don’t hinder their effect. We chat as best as we can. I, again, talk about where I came from, but this time I fill in the gaping holes of my French with English substitutes. I got a big reaction from her when I told her I arrived in the city only two hours ago. We get to the gate of the apartment complex, which is locked thanks to the French lunch hour (I’d later learn that “hour” really means “two hours”). It seems that there is no office here that ‘works through lunch’. I appreciate the French commitment to food.</p>

<p><br />
I offer to buy one of Martine’s sandwiches. She offers to let me use her phone to call the office after lunch. My time with Camion de Snack Luminy begins.</p>

<p><br />
 <a>She introduces me to several students eating her food. </a> They are polite enough, indifferent I’d say, but rightfully so. I in no way can keep up with the rate of their precious lunch gossip, which I’m sure was much more captivating to them than yet another lost American. While normal French conversation is maybe twice as fast as I need it to be to understand, their chatter was totally infeasible for me. I insert some bulky English sounds to the conversation and ask them about school. They text me a detailed digital map that is much better than that useless modern-art meets minimalist map I pulled from the train station info desk. One of the students points out some key buildings on the screen and orients me toward the Aix-Marseille University campus and Parc national des Calanques. I lift my head toward the buildings themselves and am impressed by my boldness. Unfortunately, the map has no relevance to my university, Kedge Business School. It stops just where I need it to begin, but it’s the thought that counts here I suppose. I thank them and get down to the business of lunch.</p>

<p><br />
I scan the menu, flashing back to my French classroom in high school. I open my French book to the chapter on ordering food. 
It’s blank.</p>

<p><br />
Desperately seeking not to disappoint myself, or Martine for that matter, or even Madame Caraballo at Kellam High School, I look for anything on the menu I can fake my way through.</p>

<p><br />
“Le Royal, s’il vous Plait,” sloppily falls out of my mouth. The ‘R’ was at the front of my mouth and the ‘L’ created a dumb liaison that was not proper. To boot, an air of uncertainty carried the tail end of my message away in a helium balloon along with all my hopes of sounding competent. Martine grins, confirms, and begins to make what will be my first taste of French food on French soil. 
She and her husband have owned their business and worked together in the truck for 27 years. They recently brought on their nephew, Kevin, after an unfortunate slew of allergies kicked him out of his old occupation (ah yes, the irony of a baker who can’t touch gluten). If I believed in luck, I would say that it was not on his side and that it failed in getting me to class today. I spent a good hour with them, enjoyed some mildly underwhelming food, and thoroughly enjoyed the company. I’m excited to get back to the food truck tomorrow when I’ll be able to pay them back and speak more French.</p>

                    <div class="content_div"><p>Today I walk with purpose. Two days of life through a scavenger’s eyes has caused me to warmly welcome adequacy back to my side along with some new friends. I was only able to quickly stop by Camion de Snack to repay my debt to Martine and to pick up a water bottle before class. I make my way to my last class of the week, which also happens to be the first one I’ve been able to attend. Just outside the classroom, a scattered student mass begins to gather, waiting for the room to be available. Now is the first time that I’ve had a real chance to observe the smartly dressed and put-together typecast that is the French student body. Ladies and gentlemen, they care about the way they look. No ‘comfy’ clothes for lounging in lecture halls here. Guys are wearing fitted slacks, tees, and the classic euro side-bags, while the women are completely blowing the American girls out of the water. Absolutely beautiful. And even more beautiful is the way they carry themselves. I turn to a relatably styled classmate next to me and introduce myself. She is tall, has mysterious eyes, and the persona to match. She is from Canada so of course I am the one who breaks the French a couple of moments into the conversation. She has an air about her that I wholeheartedly respect. Something like a subdued congeniality that asks me to appreciate the smallest details of her mannerisms. Her smile is honest and tells me that she appreciates our time together.<br /></p>

<p>I spend the majority of this class with a group of nine students in the back of the classroom. There seems to be an existing friendship between all of the other people in the group. I’m not sure if this is the case or if the friendly camaraderie I’ve been shown these past couple of days is expedited without a language barrier. I am impressed with the productivity of our time together. From my first impression of the classroom, I expected something very different. There are archetypes you can pick out in any group. For a classroom, these may include the Clown: looking for an audience; Mr. Cool: sitting on a desk; Madam Popular: roping another person into closing the window she just opened moments ago; the list goes on and on. But when the time comes, these differences are discarded in favor of getting the work done. I am now comfortable saying that this is the best group I’ve ever worked with. We are able to divide and delegate tasks by volunteering rather than wasting time accusing other members of not stepping up to the plate. This is asset-based community building in a pure and natural situation.<br />
I made shopping plans with a guy named Enzo from my group. He’s going to <a>show me some of the stores where I can buy things that will help me to stop living like a bum</a>—but that’s tomorrow.</p>

<p><br />
Whether we give ourselves to the moment and its potential glory or else shy away as a recluse is an argument, a conversation, which we can only introspectively conduct. Pacifism is selfish. Excluding oneself from the human existence is denying others the ability to experience you. You, in all of your joys and passions, your mistakes and mediocrities, are worth sharing. Those who seem to have more value do, because they’ve committed to themselves the value they hold and continually seek. The only opposition to this worth is esteem: the ambiguous and sly shape-shifter meandering through our veins.</p>

<p><br />
Selfish and Selfless. So close, yet so different. One is of kindness, of goodness, of purity, and of reflective compassion. The other is dark, draining, and abusive. Before we die, we need both. Conversely, an entity that hopes to live cannot be of either entirely. Why then do these hard-fought characteristics change as we enter a religious space? Voices are lowered, the extroverts diverge, and the rest of us gaze in awe. There is a dynamicism in the way a collection of walls also takes on this human dichotomy. As if living and breathing, I question if the building is passive or active, if it is conscientious and equilibrating. Perhaps it’s not, and it’s rather something entirely different. As if there isn’t any other choice, there may only be one alternative that lies in the space between. Regardless of millions of opinions, religion is and always will be at the crux of the exchange between one and the other. It serves not as a wellspring of systemic distractions, but as the only way for some to navigate good and evil.</p>

                    <div class="content_div"><p>Sunday comes with remarkable beauty. I make my way to the port and eat at my new favorite restaurant: Au Vieux Port. I can’t resist the simplicity of enjoying good food while looking out to the Mediterranean morning of Marseille. In celebration of the sublime, I welcome the finer breads, cheeses, meats, and vegetables into my life: my truest friends. Thinly-sliced saussison, mozzarella, and tomato, topped with salt, pepper, and arguably the most enticing house-mixed olive oil I’ve ever had. Beside the plate lies thick and fresh whole-grain, perfectly crunchy bread with a thin spread of silky-smooth butter. Arugula, olives, and brie cheese are on the other side of the plate topped with the restaurant’s olive oil and some thick balsamic vinegar.</p>

<p><br />
The smells, tastes, and the environment add to one entirely unprecedented appreciation for food. This brunch buffet is making my heart swell, and somehow it gets even better. I find another one of the three cheese pizzas I had last night at the end of the table. I like France.</p>

<p><br />
I am entirely satisfied with my choice to eat two plates of essentially the same thing. I step away from my table, look at the desserts, and am visibly overjoyed. The monolingual hostess, whose name I haven’t gotten yet, notices and smiles. Individual tarts and pastries glazed with some kind of sugary overcoat shimmer in the Marseille sunlight. My eyes do the same as I move down this table of edible gems. I want so badly to take one of each. I should have.</p>

<p><br />
I bring a cutely cut cube of fudge back to my table and order a coffee. There is a light dusting of white powdered sugar on top. In the middle of the square is an ornamental something; a silly berry of some kind that I won’t let distract me from the chocolate. I pushed it and it rolled cleanly from the surface of the fudge, off of my plate, and landed at the center of the table, watching in dejection. My cup came and with it came the final blow to coffee’s American doppelganger. It will never stand a chance against the European goddess demitasse of pasteurized creamy glory.</p>

<p><br />
The fudge was delicious, the coffee was good, the meal, supreme. I could wake up every morning just like this. For the first time in six days, I wish the situation could speak for itself. I wish I had the diligence to appropriately write about my deepest experiences here and how the food pulled these emotions from me. I imagine pages and pages quantifying and justifying why I enjoyed this, but for the sake of simplicity: yes, French food is good. It is very good. If you have a chance, get here, have some.</p>

</div>   
                    
                    <div class="content_div"><p>I begin at the bottom. I look at the things around me, the people I am with. I love them. These circumstances are all that I know and they are not the best. I want something better. I move myself. I am only human. Moving mountains is a daunting task, but I will try. I must because I realize that I will live, I will get attached, I will misstep, I will change, and then I will die. There needs to be something that I look back on and am proud of having built, even if this is some artificial and flawed mountain made by my hands. In the likeness of the mountains our God put on earth, I am pleased to imagine another generation learning from mine in order to build their own in it’s place. The reality is that nothing has been guaranteed to me or to any of us. This body will fail, my heart will stop, and while I can desire eternal peace all I want, desire alone is not enough to obtain it. It must be a combination of all three critical parts of me. Body, heart, and mind are pivotal in putting the immaterial within my reach. I have only one chance to make it to my goal, so there is no time to waste.</p>

<p>\ 
I begin at the bottom. I look up and imagine being at the church on the top of the mountain. I cannot see it and I don’t know what to expect. The city streets are crowded with movement: sounds, people in cars, detours, construction, police sirens, and accidents. I do not know the way, but I know where to begin and so I do.</p>

<p><br />
As I walk, I look at the buildings and the homes people have made. They are safe and the families inside stay. What reason do they have to make their way to the top? They can see the sky’s beauty from their windows. The sun rises every morning and they can feel golden warmth coming from the top of the belfry. They can see the sun in its entirety which seems to be good enough, for they have built their homes on their way to holiness. What more needs to be done? I have not been given such privilege. In quiet acceptance, as I have learned, there is no such thing as ‘fair.’</p>

<p>\ 
i. I move my feet, slowly starting up the steep path. Fast–moving cars pass me and I brush against the dirty wall trying to keep my distance from them. They are too close for my comfort. I cross streets, pass through alleyways, and make room for the strangers crossing paths. I am shown the ranges of humanity: businessmen, families, the homeless, the working–class, and the white-collar workers. I question if they are where they want to be, if they’ve reached their goals, and how they got to be at the altitude they live at now. Each of their stories is no less complicated than mine. As I climb, I am shown the outcome of our lives; I am shown how our choices change our trajectory. I see where I will one day be. Which person, specifically, I do not know.</p>

<p><br />
My body aches as I begin the hardest part of the climb. My legs pulse on the off-steps and my ankles are relieved for the moments that my body’s weight is on them. I pass the houses and move out of the residential zone. I am in a space now devoid of the sounds that come from a home, from the colors of personality, and from paved concrete pathways. The hill gets steeper and the gravel falls behind my feet. I look back and notice the small wry limestone shards falling away.</p>

<p>\ 
ii. I read, “Jesus Takes Up His Cross” on a stone plaque cemented into a rock next to the path. I imagine the burden pressing against His body. The thorns push deeper into Your head as Your Father’s desires are pushed onto You. Silently accepted, You carry the cross for me. I will not falter; I cannot. But when I do, I will not stay there. I see those around me, and then the ones that I love, and try hard to give of myself so that they might have the ability to build their own futures. I am futile. I am weak. I am only a man and I am only human. I may be lost if You had not carried the cross for me.</p>

<p><br />
iii. You fell; You understand that when I fall, I will get up. The sharp edges of the stones on my palms and knees are more painful than the hardest part of an easy life. I cannot stay down, lest I lose myself forever. Push off, embrace the pain, and look forward to the other side. These moments are a gift, and mine to accept if only I focus on my eyes and not those of the crowd. The judgmental, the selfish, the tears from the ones I love. In turmoil, we are uniquely vulnerable. These moments mean the most and the sake of our future is dependent on them.</p>

<p><br />
iv. Let the wicked scream and let the damned rage, but do not let me see tears from my mother. She’s raised a man that will fight for her far past death. When I was a child, my nightmares stole sleep. Over the years, those painful scenes I dreamed of made their way into reality. I am not strong like You. I will give all of myself to protect her and to fend off evil. Nothing should separate the bond between mother and child. I reflect on an offender; someone I cannot control. As You carried the cross, You saw your mother seeing You. In tears she came to You while jeering people led you to death. Your mother sees You in blood, in weakness, in pain, naked, and alone. You see her and console her. I, in my worldly mind, question my frustration. How can a son do this? You are able to give Your mother peace as You physically have none left. You are at peace amongst the greatest discord. I am in awe of Your mind and confidence. You are the one who carries the world’s people on Your shoulders as those same people reach down and peel back your skin.</p>

<p>\ 
v. If I keep my eyes fixed on You and watch how You suffered, will I be able to pick up and bear my cross as You have? I face fear, pain, and suffering, but not with Your faith. What is the purpose of Simon? In a moment, his life changed. He was thrown to the center of attention and asked to become someone known throughout history. I’m sure he wondered, as he took the beams upon his shoulders, why he was given a burden this great. This is the same question I struggle with. With the passing of time, I see You permit suffering to weave itself in and out of my life. As my achievements grow so do the sufferings. Make me understand that You look at these struggles and hold them fondly before You pass them on to me. You watch me and give me strength just as You did Simon. For he and I are the men that help our brothers, and in turn serve You, our God, in times of need.</p>

<p>\ 
vi. A man with burning legs and pulsing ankles, with Your torn back and bleeding head, should be the easiest to pity. To find solidarity with another person’s pain is the most human reaction. I imagine You didn’t look for another in this crowd for such pity. Were there any that would give it to You? They saw You and should have helped from the beginning, yet none did. None but Veronica, a woman distraught by Your state; yet when she comforted You, You reflected the same kindness back to her.</p>

<p><br />
vii. I stop and rest my hands on my hips. I don’t understand. I read about Your victory in failure. I hear that in falling a second and third time, You show strength. How? Is it something as basic as the ability to fall and to continue? I understand and at the same time I do not. I raise my head and look at the rooftops below me. I move on, breathing deeply.</p>

<p><br />
viii. As I push forward, the city becomes smaller and smaller behind me. I think about the people I’ve passed and the thousands I haven’t seen in Marseille. I think about the restaurants, the shops, the bars, the lights of the city, the massive ferris wheel with metal joints illuminated in purple and blue. The sky rusts to deep orange. Of the genuine people I’ve met, how many appreciate this church that overwhelms me as I see it emerging from the trees? Do we care about the things that have been on a shelf our entire lives? Is that what this is to them? Some dusty trinket that inspires postcards and trivial things? Is disinterest a deeper hate than what Jesus saw at His Passion? As the holy women cried before Him, He turned their eyes to the violent, swearing crowd, with people refusing to accept God’s son.</p>

<p><br />
This crowd is now a different kind; more feeble and more distracted. I stand by a throng that took the bus up the ascent. There are tourists who pose on the steps to the church, one foot proudly landing a step above the other, or casually lounging on the low cement guardrail flipping their hair away from their aviators for a ‘fabulous traveler’ look. I’m beginning to understand how You felt. I know that indifference is more painful because here I feel the same flippancy from the crowd in the pit of my stomach. The people before cared enough to definitively deny You. Now I question how little Your existence means to those who use your grounds as a backdrop for a gratifying picture of themselves saying, “IDK, it shows I have depth.”</p>

<p><br />
You know me. You know my love for others. I am conflicted in finding the balance between honesty and eloquence. My tendency to be brutal against these types of people is a corner I’m rounding out. Your humanity was acknowledged in Your Passion. Here at this church it is not. The clothing of ‘humanity’ is what connects each of us. Removing that commonality dehumanizes us. To be stripped of these common threads is damaging like no other kind of hate.</p>

<p><br />
ix. As I write, I think about Your falling and explore my own shortcomings. I question the areas of my character and my person, and I see that I am jagged and flawed in nearly every way. My actions turn me red with embarrassment or shame. Through my inaction, I am often sent reeling into disappointment and frustration. In the darkness and recesses of our form, we are given way to You. Repetition, error, and resurgence is key; three things that tell me that our faults are actually bringing us closer to perfection. You are the maker of our shape and shade and are the maker of the infinitely more complicated universe.</p>
