  <div class="content_div"><p>The French language is not some club to be held in an exclusive manner. The popular perspective claiming that French should only be spoken perfectly creates insurmountable barriers for those without fluency. I live in a country where I am not fluent in the dominant language and have to address this confusing mental block in order to survive. I hope others facing similar hurdles do the same. <br />
<br />
Language may be accessed at many levels, but when I first saw French on a chalkboard, I was consistently overwhelmed. While I learned it quickly then, I did not feel much passion for it. Piece by piece, I now learn how to use the classroom vocabulary that I once wrote on worksheets for a red marker check. Whether it be mere interest or the ordinary pursuit of living well here, I have rekindled the fire to overcome the learning curve. I am not proficient, nor do I possess the flexibility of good syntax, but I am getting things done, which is the most basic purpose of communication. What more could I ask for? Technically nothing unless I use a translator.</p>

As if I could forget where I am. Shame on me for trying to make these walls feel a bit more like home. These things around me fall down and so I reach down and re-secure them with care.</p>

  <div class="content_div"><p>This old parish protects me and a few others from the howling winds that wail just outside the creaky wooden doors. My canvas shoes are wet and my bones feel pain me through every step. It is dusk on the third Thursday that I’ve been here in France. The overcast sky and watery streets creep into the cracked church and dampen the walls. Since they cannot force their way in entirely, I imagine this is the most dreary ambiance they can muster. The colors around me are black and blue and stone gray. The chill and hollow empty space are causing the church to be blustery and cold. I kneel on the smooth rounded bar at my feet and let the discomfort in my bones distract the rest of my body from the cold. I reflect on the days that have passed.<br />
<br />
I began this morning with appointments at LCL Bank and EDF Electricity. Finally, some obligations to tend to! I’ve missed the feeling of structure that they give me. My time as a traveler is fine, but I greatly appreciate the feeling of purpose in a daily routine. Crossing the appointments off my list was rewarding. This Saturday I’m meeting with Enzo and some new friends for the Marseille-Evian soccer match. Next weekend I am either going to Grenoble or Milan. Separate groups are traveling to each respective city; we’ll see which one has their act together. Several American students studying in Paris, Lyon, and Marseille are planning a Valentine’s Day weekend trip to Barcelona. Birds of a feather eventually find one another on Facebook. After these 13 days of freedom from social chains, I admit it is nice to be back in the middle of it. <br />
<br />
My mind is a treacherous place to be. Days and nights are so different and the life I want to lead seems like a distant fantasy. What am I to do if the problems I face are the very backbone of existence? I am like this building. The winds, the cold, the worldly dissonance are all pushing at the doors. And here I am inside trying my hardest to distract myself from calamity, before the altar, burning with a single red candle.</p>

    <div class="content_div"><p>What is it about the nature of odd or even that influences our minds? I’ve been taught to design in odd numbers. However, we sometimes elements need to stick out, and at other times, we want to blend in, especially now in foreign territory. The holiness of the number seven is so close to the menace of six yet infinitely more superior. We try our entire lives to bridge the gap of one and many can’t. The love of three parts created a single one, to come into life to demystify the path leading from one to the other. Simplicity, I fear, makes things more difficult. Knowing the odds you’re up against reveals the opposition we face. For someone like myself, that opposition often seems too large to overcome.</p>

<p>The difference one makes in the scale of eternity is far greater than I ever imagined. The name makes it accessible. Close enough to achieve, but not within reach. I continue with the odds in my favor; I’ll take all the help I can get.</p>

                            <p>I promised myself I would write something once I got to the top of the mountain. <a class="E25_I1">Here I am at as the sun lowers, hidden behind a large jagged rock overlooking the water.</a> The biting wind is painfully chilling the sweat on my back. Four hours on and off the trail got me to this point. I set out without the end in mind and I can’t imagine ending anywhere else but here.<br /><br />
With my camera, a scarf, two oranges, a water bottle, my journal, and a pair of sunglasses packed into my grey Jan Sport, I started up to the coast. I hiked past Martine’s and the line at her food truck, and then past the official at the park reserve offices. There was a vagrant hiker returning from his stroll. My contact with people quickly ended, however, once I hit gravel.<br />\</p>
<blockquote class="E25_Q1">The path was completely deserted for these next hours.</blockquote>
<p><br /><br />
I hiked and made progress toward the highest peak. I watched the path as it curved around the mountain, barely making progress toward the top. I saw it bend out of view and then return in the other direction 40 feet up the mountainside. This frustrated me. I wanted a straight line, something more direct toward the summit. I kept my heading on the compacted dirt for the sake of consistency. I left the path a few times to explore caves, lookout points, or challenging ascents. I lost my footing on the scraggly limestone gravel and cut my hands on stiff thorny bushes. They continue to see me stumble and kick me when I’m down. They leave a tally on my hands for every time I fall.<br /><br />
Atop one of the rock tables, I noticed a slight glimmer coming from the corner of a small, exposed rock. I crouched down to inspect it and see some crystalline structure grown from pressure. I quickly deduce this is not a stone of any value, but nevertheless I collect some nicely angled pieces in the palm of my hand and hold them. I am pleased to have been rewarded with these pale stones from my side-excursion. I carefully added them to my backpack. When I got back up, my footing was abruptly shifted by the coastal wind. I lifted my head and looked further to the side to see that three feet away was the edge of the table. I thought about how I could die here.<br /><br />
The descent is more dangerous than the climb. On the way up, gravity works as an equalizer and slows your pace against the mountain. Coming down, however, gravity works in the same direction as you do, resulting in an ease on your muscles. You accomplish more with less, your focus loosens, and before you know it, gravity pushes your slipping foot down and without a quick reaction, the rest of you will follow. If you aren’t careful, you fall down just when the path seems to get easier. You begin grabbing at anything to get yourself back up, even those damned bushes that cut your palms. Again, I think about how I could die here. <br />\</p>
<blockquote class="E25_Q2">I continued on the main path and decided that for now, it’s okay to meander up the side of the mountain.</blockquote>
<p>It led me to views of Marseille and the Mediterranean Sea that I had never seen before. It gave me a tour of some neighboring cities far off in the distance along with several colorful rock formations jutting out into the water. This path was a challenge. It led me up and down the mountain and I didn’t reach the top until the very end of my trek. I faced a final large white ascent via meandering makeshift-stairs that steeply led me to the peak. Glancing between my footing and the path in front of me, disorientation slowed me down. My vision faded in and out as I made slow progress, but refused to stop. I was well aware of the danger. <br />
Filled with adrenaline, I made the final step toward the highest surface. There are no trail markings around me. There are no paths and no people. Looking around, I notice the edge of the cliff with the sea before me. To my right lies a path back towards Luminy, and to the left is Cassis miles away in the distance. I notice a dark stone pillar standing about 6 feet high, but make nothing of it. I make my way toward the very edge of the rocky cliff to behold the water and the expansive horizon before me. I imagine reaching Africa beyond my side of the water. I am still for a moment. <br />
I think about the world and begin to imagine myself from above. I see the coast, I see Notre Dame de la Garde, I see Marseille, and I see the Mediterranean countries. I cross water and land, then the entirety of the Atlantic Ocean, and I see Virginia. I am with my family and my friends; I think about how selfish it is for me to be abroad and alone. They need me and I want to be there for them. I am sad to think of what I’m missing, such as the celebrations and happy moments of my loved ones, including the harder moments. I am sad to be alone for this moment. For so long, I’ve been an advocate for independence and that being alone doesn’t make you lonely by default. Frankly, I am lonely up here on the cold mountain top, as if the presence of another would make it any warmer. <br />
I am proud of where I come from and perhaps that is why I miss it. I pick up a hefty, rounded rock with two hands and move to the edge. I want to be present for this entire journey; I want to rid myself of these thoughts that weigh me down. I let these negative thoughts leave my body by speaking my frustrations to the stone, listing names and intentions. I moved toe-to-toe with the edge of the cliff and yell as I hurl it as far away from me as I can. I look for the rock, but can’t see it once it drops beneath the edge. The pain in my throat remains. <br />
I am beyond self-doubt and confliction. I am here and am wholly present. I remind myself that I am 20 years old and living and thriving alone in a new part of the world. These feelings of isolation were expected and aren’t surprising. I remind myself that my life is changing every day and that the sacrifices I made to my family are noble, coming from the best intentions. I am not in Marseille to escape the life I lead, but to learn to be better for it. Down the road, this sacrifice will pay itself back.<br />
The wind continues to keep me on my toes, correcting my balance as it precisely moves through the threads of my clothes onto my body. I shiver, look up, and see the sun peek through the clouds. My throat burns from the strain on my vocal chords. I welcome the pain because it creates contrast amidst the cold of the air pushing around me. It’s a fire inside my body. I’ve given myself this heat source. I turn and walk in the direction of the stone pillar I noticed earlier, deep in thought. My eyes widen and stomach lurches when I realize that my next step will be into the air, off of the cliff. I think about how I could die here.<br />
I correct my heading and look in the direction of the pillar. There is a metal grating across a recess in the front. I imagine some sort of alcove for a statue in a church. I’m not sure what it is. I stop in front of it to inspect the thick, round structure and find a rope keeping the gate shut. I untie the gate, gently move it open, and see a rope hanging down the middle. I look down into the hole and am confused by the depth of the blackness. The noise of the wind stops. I can feel the sun completely. I retract my head from the stones and see that the trees are still. I turn back towards the object in front of me. It’s a well. I’ve never seen one before and stare as if it’s some fantastic thing from a child’s story. I pull on the thin coarse rope until a dented metallic bucket comes up. Echoes from falling water bounce off of the stone walls. I set the bucket on the sill and look at it, observing its familiarity, smooth sides, and dull metallic marbling. I touch my fingertips into the water, bringing a few drops to the center of my forehead. The wind comes back with vengeance and nudges the bucket off the sill. I catch the rope and lower it back into the hole, close the grating, and turn to hike back in the direction of Luminy. The sun is nearly gone and it will only get colder.</p>

  <div class="content_div"><p>I bought my train ticket and made plans to get to Avignon yesterday evening. It was a spur-of-the moment decision, the likes of which I don’t normally make. I stress myself out.</p>

<p>I found some comfort in the tight schedule I made. I planned out every minute from wake at 5:30 until 23:00. If for no other reason than to cross each item off the list and celebrate another slightly greater, successful venture. Today though, when I pull into Avignon across the Rhone River Bridge, I see the city’s outer ramparts and the Palais du Papes towering above the city’s dull orange tiled roofs.</p>

<p>Mass was in the Avignon Basilica. The golden altar, the oil paintings, the stained glass, the incense, the language, the sounds of the organ and its single unfortunately detuned key used only in the recessional hymn, culminated to an oddly memorable and transportive experience. The day, like the city, pairs modernity and history in a way that is unique to Avignon. In the blue-orange morning light, I explored the Palace of the Popes which is surrounded by 14th century architecture. I am impressed by the power of the Church, its ability to influence daily life, and its ability to make me feel small; to remind me that I am single being among many. Like ants piling dirt, this massive palace was built by 850 people in 20 years. Each individual’s story and strength are more than mine, and yet all these differences came together to build one brilliant monument that attempted to glorify God. I reflect on the radical movements in music that the Church inspired at the time; specifically, Guillaume de Machaut and Francesco Landini’s push for the new arts and polyphony (names I only remember because of my studies in Music Academy back home). I think about living in a world or a city centered around the Church. It’s a theoretically beautiful idea, but when I apply it to reality, I am conflicted.</p>

  <div class="content_div"><p>Just when I begin to feel in control, You bring me here and remind me of my place. <a class="E25_I1">I sit at the back of this space against the wall on the bench made for people like me.</a> My eyes move through the emptiness before my feet, filling in the floor as it would have been 800 years ago. My senses are intrigued by the deep colors and glimmering gold, the smell, the sun sifting through the stained glass and dusty air, the fabrics and feel of the hundreds of holy vestments. I look at myself. Who would I have been? Could I have made it here in this building? Is this someplace I would even want to be? The contingency of another lifetime leaves me only with questions. I see the crowds of people who are truly holier than I lined towards the altar. I see the bishops, cardinals, and then the Pope at this time, Benedict XIII. I hear choirs singing praises to the heavens. How many of them acknowledge and appreciate the blessing they’ve been given? Music changes hearts, and yet the mouths the voices come from sometimes leave their own unchanged. I see design, hierarchy, and human next to human piecing together one body. This is one body built from many, and I no longer wonder where my part is in it. I am small. I am an outsider here, an observer to some extent. I watch and I see through the crowd. Their bodies no longer affect my experience, for this room holds only space now. I see You at the front and myself at the back.</p>

<p>Here, in this lifetime, at this year, and in this moment, there is nothing but a stone floor between You and me.</p>

                            <p>I spent the second half of the day with new people. <a class="E28_I1">A photo-op that I couldn’t pass up resulted in my meeting Morgan and Bolgarov right outside of the city walls.</a> They were on their bikes in front of the stone city ramparts. I saw them marking up the garden terraces and modern cement underpass near the highway. They welcomed my camera and my simple French.</p>

<blockquote class="E28_Q1">Morgan excitedly took me around the gardens and shared the lines he had been working on.</blockquote>

<p>He and his bike moved like I had never seen before. He managed to get up on a 5-foot planter, balance on a thin ledge, and then cleanly get back down. Since I was too surprised to take a decent photo, I could only look at him wide-eyed with a goofy smile on my face. I let him know that I missed the shot, and so he and I toured the grounds, while Bolgarov practiced near the wall. Both of them consistently surprised me. We began as three, but before I knew it others were joining us, hopping out of cars on the highway and from behind the wall to meet up with us. We were eight by the end of the night, moving from spot to spot in the city laughing, taking photos, talking, and asking questions about one another. At the square in front of the palace, a friend was waiting with a Spanish guitar, a cajón, and a <a class="E28_I2">puppy</a> — a good combo if you ask me</p>

<blockquote class="E28_Q2">We played music and sang just like back home.</blockquote>

<p>I felt comfortable, especially considering that I am way off of my schedule.</p>

<p>The sun set, it got cold, and I wanted to eat. They wanted McDonald’s and I did not. I did not come to Europe to pay 10 euros for a Big Mac when I could get a great bottle of wine for the same price. Before I left the group for my meal, we connected on Facebook, said our good byes, gave bises, and did this French double tap handshake (that I still don’t think is cool).</p>

My grandmother quickly swatted the back of my head when I over-zealously mixed the dry ingredients up and into the air or made little animals out of the pierogi.<br />
<br />
I remember energetically directing my brothers and friends as we constructed forts in woods behind the neighborhood. I was the one confirming the perfect spot when we found it and helping the others imagine what the finished structure would look like. When the sun began setting we’d get whistled in for dinner and race out of the treeline back home.<br />
<br />
Idyllic childhood scenes like these abruptly ended when my family divorced in 2008.<br />
<br />
The mortgage collapse ruined my family’s finances and triggered our unraveling. After the departure of my father and my older brother, I took on their roles as a financial partner and the eldest sibling. The heroes that I once thought were flawless – my mother, my father, my extended family – all turned glaringly mortal as they went separate ways.<br />

We were once a nuclear household of seven consisting of my two parents, my three other brothers, my mother’s sister, and three or four pets. We were often the gathering grounds for parties and holidays. I was 12 when these things stopped happening and when the house started falling apart.<br />
<br />
We could no longer afford the mortgage, A/C, or utilities. The fridge was empty and so was the tank in our car. Our credit score plummeted. We quickly became the eye-sore house in the neighborhood. The yard was overgrown, the pool was green, and the HOA regularly fined us for not keeping up appearances. On the outside everything changed for the worse, and so did I on the inside.<br />
<br />
My priorities shifted away from the things that brought me joy — art, music, fashion, my band, my creativity — and my presence got meek and small. Unlike my peers, I didn’t have the time, money, or emotional capacity to cope with socializing in public school. My reality deviated, I was isolated, and I began to accept the terms of a new norm.<br />
<br />
To support my mother and brothers, I worked my ass off every day after school. As soon as I turned 18, I was made manager of a franchised business and began to see how I could make a future that provided my family with little more than the bare minimum. Every night when I closed the store, I turned the music way up on the sound system and balanced the books in the back office. After work responsibilities were done, I did my homework there late into the night. I had plans to keep that job after graduation. It wasn’t much, but I felt like I had achieved something with my life.</p>

<p>One night, late, my mother pulled me aside and made me make a promise. She said:</p>

<p>“You remember how mad grandma used to get at you for ‘getting creative’ when we baked with them? Or that time I freaked out ‘cause I thought I lost you guys, but you had spent the whole day building a fort in the woods? You are capable of so much more than what you’re doing now…Promise you won’t be like me. Don’t settle. Don’t defeat yourself. Get a degree and learn to believe in yourself.”</p>

<p>I was most courageous when I decided to face my demons, depression, and my abysmal self-esteem. I chose to believe that I was worth more than minimum wage and that I had more to offer the world than just a painstakingly crafted in-store Pandora playlist.</p>

<p>Over a period of years, I’ve gotten closer to the unrelenting, devilish, curious, and endearing spirit with which I was born. Every day I do better at authentically presenting myself and doing so with a child-like enthusiasm. It’s scary and difficult. I harken back to that promise between my mom and I because it represents the most courageous and most rewarding first leap of faith. I make that same step every day, but it’s become easier and easier to do.</p>

  <div class="content_div"><p>The problems we think we have and the hardships we face now; pain is not relative. It needs to be held in a constant proportion to the goals we all live for. I write from the inside of a cell. The image of my face is reflected on the glass pane that covers one of the doors of a Gestapo detainment block. Two artists have been at work on this medium. The prison walls have the dingy defiled characteristics only Time has the patience to craft. The other man inside, someone whom I’ve grown to admire, has left his mark over Time’s signature. Letters, words, calendars, and drawings are engraved now in both serious and cynical detail for the world to see.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Time is torture and it is more than the physical torment this man endured. Time does not feel fatigue, Time has no schedule. Time, the ruthless limiter, pushes you from moments of happiness and enjoys the slowness of misery. You stand in the middle of the dark space you have for a mind. The dimensions are your choosing, but ultimately the measurements around you are irrelevant; the shade meets you wherever you choose to stand. He or she, the androgynous phantom, approaches the noisy iron and wood door at the front. The door cracks. You see light race past the tall silhouette towards you. Burning in your mind, burning in your temples, you close your eyelids until your lashes start to filter it out. The being arches its back to walk through the frame, it closes the door, and is lost for a moment in the darkness of your consciousness. Your eyes, now open, are relieved not to know its whereabouts. You don’t want to know and at the same time you do. At least you think you do.\</p>

<p>And so you do. In dull golden garb, a footsteps into the white light around you, followed by its torso and countenance, filled by with shadow. These moments pass slowly. These movements, the steps toward you, take years. Your breath fluctuates. In your emptiness, you gasp for air and in consolation you relieve your seams before they tear. Cloth dangles from the arms of the creature. It begins to move up toward you. It defies the gravity that pushes it down and in a way that is too fluid for the gaunt and lanky body parts in front of you. Its boney black hand settles on your shoulder. You stare for a moment, chained by fear, and look into the ambiguous visage facing you now. What barely resembles a face stares through your eyes into the back of your skull. Its calloused and rough hand slides to the base of your neck. You feel it on your skin rising up to your head. Nail leads finger into ear. You’ve gone unconscious and time moves on without you.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
I stand at this door and see a face reflecting back at me in the spaces between iron bars. I can only see the bottom of his nose to the top of his shoulders in this small gap. There is not enough detail to tell clearly, but it causes me to question on which side of the door it is that I stand. I am connected to this man although I don’t recognize him through the window. I know him through his writing, his carvings and this connects us. He writes to create a world outside of his own. He writes to turn time away and for reasons only he can truly understand. I write to capture the thoughts and the details of the moments time takes away from me. I want to remember the way I think now.\</p>

<p>Although our words are different, both escape the threats of death and traps of time. You learn from me and I’ve learned from you. What’s more, I’ve been inspired by you. I admire you although I don’t know you. Similar and so different. I see your cause and I carry the message forward. I carry your mind and your nameless intelligence. Your pride and your devout servitude are relevant especially now. The man turns to leave the window and we go our separate ways.</p>

    <div class="content_div"><p>My relationship with my new peers is unique and unlike any that I’ve ever had before. I barely speak French and they barely speak English. A large amount of the words we use back home are unknown to the non-native, and often are not even used in the way that their definition suggests. I notice something similar here. There is a point where we begin to bend the rules of what our words mean and our emotions move the messages in between the lines. Colloquialisms fill in the spaces of our words as decoration. Neither side has this luxury anymore if they hope to get their point across. We are often limited to the most basic vocabulary and must present ideas in the most honest way. This is the result of honest relationship building. There is no mincing of words or annotating of speech bubbles here. We present what we have, stripped of all hidden agendas. For my overly-active mind and social anxiety, this has been an unexpected breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>There is something to be said for the exchange students from the States as well. There is a strong sense of alignment between us— an acknowledgement that we are all up against the same difficulties and are just trying to piece together these accented vowels and backwards adjectives.</p>

The windows are open to the chilly red night sky and I hear the street sounds below. I’m cooking with Lucas while Brent fills glasses of wine across the two joined tables we pushed together. It’s loud and there’s music in the background.</p>

<p>I found my way in with this group while writing at the port in Marseille. They are all kind enough and have personalities that pique my interest. Tomorrow we will ski the French Alps together. The mountains loom in the distance. For now, I will enjoy a wide conversation that is friendly enough, but laced with unnecessarily sharp opinions.</p>

  <div class="content_div"><p>Creativity and innovation are related in opposite ways. On one hand they’ve devolved to be meaningless, questionable, and the most unimportant part of what someone says. While on the other hand they overflow with the sincerity, complexity and magic which makes the human experience so special.</p>

<p>On the end of meaninglessness, the word ‘creativity’ and ‘innovation’ suffer from semantic drift and gross overuse. When they are used, one of two responses usually follows. The first is an immediate onslaught of other words used to prop up, unpack, or explore the original word. The second response is a resounding silence with faces that could (maybe) be interpreted as deep pensive thought; a furrowed brow; or, my personal favorite, an agreeable series of head nods, pretending to ‘get it’, and then going about their day unchanged because what was described was neither creative nor innovative.</p>

<p>Businesses cling to these ideas as if they were real, tactile pillars of their offering or as keystones of what makes them worth buying. They are treated as commodities that were done intentionally and are available equitably. They are neither of those things.</p>

<p>Creativity and innovation are verbs informed by their surroundings; they are responses to externalities. They require the presence of some context in order to exist meaningfully. That context can come in many forms. It can be social, environmental, or systemic processes which drive action. They can be creative processes informed by drugs, an unhinged lifestyle, or an obsessively-made studio space. Absorbing any of these happenings around them, creativity and innovation respond via some medium. The outcome questions reality as it exists and challenges the expectations one has for the life which they lead. Because of this dependence on context, true creativity or innovation is hard to come by and impossible to plan for.</p>

<p>Therefore, and on the other hand, we find that the two words are related by the resounding fullness of their meaning. They describe experiences which are so attuned to the happenings of mankind that we are brought to tears, gaze in awe, or are instinctually obliged to own whatever the thing is. They describe the fascination with objects imbued with such authenticity that they feel to become a part of you. They are objects which facilitate more-human relationships or make you feel understood, seen, or validated by others.</p>

<p>Stories about this caliber of creativity and innovation are the same ones we all know to some degree: Jackson Pollock’s reclusive and alcoholic process informing his impact on art; Walt Disney reimagining machinery for storytelling, world-building and delight; Steve Jobs’ intense personality driving change to HCI and technology. These figures have legacy now because they were brave enough to offer their creations to the world. In turn, they are celebrated for their impact on people’s lives.</p>

<p>In the cases of business, legacy’s are continued over many lifetimes and naturally evolve as their contexts evolve. Disney is not the same company it was 100 years ago. Nearly everything about that entity’s context has changed and yet it continues to be creative and innovate. The life and values of Walt still informs the company’s actions today. There’s that idea that says, “It’s 10% the way you behave and 90% why you behave that way.” So if the ‘Why’ is centered on authenticity, and we know that context is ever-changing, then all a company needs to do is act when the time is right.</p>

<p>A recent example of this is AirBnB’s response to the Covid Pandemic. Their product-wide shift to stay-cations and in-home events is a market innovation derived from a changed narrative. That, coupled with authentic tone and manner, made it one of the most heartening news updates I got in the middle of 2020. Of course, it was AirBnB’s core motivators which drove that change and ultimately will inform its successes as times continue to change. The differentiator here, however, is not only that they observed the change and pivoted, but that they were poised to do so as soon as context required it.</p>

<p>Creativity and innovation are related in that they are both meaningless and powerful beyond definition. Their meaning relies on their context and our willingness to respond with sincerity. That means that the only thing standing in between an individual and creative/innovative greatness is a willingness to be vulnerable– to go out on a limb and to dare to do things differently. We as creative people must be more willing to leave behind the B.S. buzzwords, our obsession with what others are doing, and our fear of being bad in order to articulate our own response to the world. Otherwise, we’ll be left with a burnt-out planet, mediocre work, and a vocabulary of words that don’t mean a thing.</p>

The surroundings alternate between wide open moonlit fields and condensed black within tight concrete tunnels. The wind pierces my ears when we dive under the countryside hills. There is intense pressure on my eardrums as we enter and exit. My eyes are itchy. My throat is dry. I’m tired. I’ve been skiing, eating, laughing, and becoming more thankful for sleep day by day. I’ve been anxious and reluctantly annoyed, which means I’ve made friends as well as some acquaintances. I’m proud of the way I’ve handled myself throughout each of these situations.</p>

<p>I’m excited to get back to my apartment and unpack my souvenirs from Grenoble. They include the pile of emerald green broken glass, a well-designed tourism guide, the winter issue of BeStreet magazine, evergreen from the top of the French Alps, ivy from the base of the Bastille, and several other smaller papers and posters from around the city and the Musée Dauphinois.</p>

<p>Hold on, another tunnel…</p>

<p>The shrill sound numbs my brain and breaks my concentration. I wish I had been able to find a gift for my mother because seasonal French retail sales are happening now. I’ve only got a few days until they end. The dark night and romantic speckled stars pass from my view.</p>

<p>My mind is blurry from the disorienting late night ride from Marseille. I spent yesterday in my apartment slowly working on a presentation concerning the broad topic of ‘leadership’ for one of my classes.</p>

<p>I get off the bus in groggy disarray from a cold’s onset and from 9 sleepless hours in a cramped space. My pursed eyes and scratchy throat are making it difficult to enjoy my arrival to Barcelona. I step down and pass a few other riders while I look for a place to sit, recuperate, and pull together a plan for when the sun rises. I cross the horseshoe-shaped cobblestone bus bay, under streetlights that are notably different from the color I remember back home. These are gentler and have a warmness about them that isn’t so abrasive against the sleeping world. I enter through a slow-to-react automatic door and sit down for a moment. It isn’t long before another rider from the bus promptly approaches me and extends her hand for an introduction.</p>

<p>Becca is from San Francisco and is taking courses in Aix-en-Provence, majoring in French and anthropology. She is 20 years old, finishing her Bachelor’s Degree in a total of six years, has her septum pierced, and wears clothes that befit a true frenchie. At heart however, Becca is a Californian, born and raised. She’s a photographer and I can tell she has quite the eye for it by the way she sporadically pulls out her camera. Needless to say, I’m excited to be meeting someone that looks like the kind of person I would choose to get to know. Diversity is important for a group, but every now and then it’s nice to relate to a person because of similarities and not differences. With no additional direction, we take to the streets. She talks well and thinks even better. Becca is a critic of all the external forces around her. Political oppression, humanistic causes, child labor, and material consumption; you name it, she’s thought about it. If she hasn’t, she won’t fib her way through or change the subject. If she doesn’t know, then she doesn’t know, and that’s easy enough for her to say. She is cautious of both the things she lets into her life and how those things represent who she is.</p>

<p>In the morning dark, we search for open food spots, criticize street art, and learn about one another. For a beat, the ‘east versus west coast’ debate flares but quickly gives way. I’m uninterested in this battle of bias and thankfully she is too. Since I’m unsure of how long our time together will be, I hesitate to offer the food I packed for today. Food is my best friend. As we walk I notice both of us mentally slipping, distracted by our stomachs. The conversation spreads and gets notably slower. Our steps up the hill push breath between our words. I cave and offer to share what I’ve packed for myself. We pick a bench in one of Barcelona’s many city parks to become our table.</p>

<p>A stagnant brass two-story fountain is to my left and another warm streetlight shines down on our wooden bench. We are in a closed-off bubble built from the brightness and shadow cast by the light above. Like looking out of a window at night, we can’t see out, but others can see in. We went back and forth about art, sociology, and our goals. She is kind and, within these first hours, I see admirable integrity.</p>

A moment like this happened as Becca and I sat on the bench having our breakfast. The washed-out blue morning sky slowly brightened and came into its own. At the apex of the sky’s change, the streetlights in the park flicker off and, as if a curtain were raised, we were suddenly part of a much bigger and more colorful world again. I noticed the bikes, the dogs on leashes, and the man cleaning the concrete outside his store. Our conversation stopped for a time as we took in the change to our environment. It was a special moment that won’t soon leave my mind; an open invitation from the city, letting me know that the day had officially begun.</p>

  <div class="content_div"><p>We are never finished, not until we die. And even then, are we? Who we are changes day by day, little by little. That’s why people say, “I haven’t changed.” Because these changes are so small that they aren’t noticed when they happen and, therefore aren’t perceived. Usually only after a hole has been completely filled do we give ourselves credit for the work we’ve done. Those who truly stop changing are to be pitied. Encourage them to work again. To be deprived of the ability to grow can be a side effect of the human burden. Push malignancy, self-deprecation, inadequacy, opposition, doubt, amateurism, and the always-important ego aside. See space not as what it isn’t, but what it could be. Embrace your ability to create something lasting for the world to one day stand before and look foolish gawking at.</p>

</div>   
  <div class="content_div"><p>I’m not expecting the ride back to Marseille to be any better than it was on the way down. I’m prepping for the worst. I collect the last 5 euros from my pockets and set out to find dinner. As I make my way from store to store, I collect some seeded green grapes for €2.15, two Granny Smith apples for €1.15, and a crusty round loaf of bread for €1.20. I celebrate this small victory and welcome back the leftover 50 centimes to my pocket.\</p>

<p>My path leads me across Barcelona’s Arc de Triomfe. With time to spare before my bus leaves at midnight, I step beneath the arch and into an area outlined by palm trees, ornate brass lampposts with more warm orange lights, and concrete benches. <a class="E41_I1">The rectangle-shaped plaza is filled with strolling couples, a few skateboarders, and dogs running free as their owners take back the daily tourist’s haven.</a> I claim a bench, take off my shoes, cross my legs, and have my meal, ending the trip in a similar manner as I started it. This time there are a few differences, however, and the greatest is acknowledged as I speak to myself, panning across the docile cityscape.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>You are not asked to internalize the changes I inspire within you now. You are not asked to hold onto the victories you win here. You are called to act on them. You will build from stone and mind and they will flock to celebrate our victory– interdependence in the flesh. You will make a monument that will stand for generations to come. The people that feel the least important carve their names onto your walls to feel remembered. These are the ones you seek to change. You give them this immaterial worth through the materials of your choosing. You will be the way for others to reach greater fulfillment. You will be remembered after you leave.\</p>

<p>Only timidity keeps you from achieving your dreams. When you see the needy, your mind is the only obstacle keeping you from making a difference. I require your commitment to others and I, your conscience, won’t relent until you’ve stepped up to these obligations. I pull on your heart every time you turn down their suffering. You can change others; I’ve deepened your love and you can change their world. \</p>

<p>Tonight you see what I mean. In darkness and frustration, a man with no teeth and no English will approach you. As you speak, he understands. Searching for something irrelevant, you are met with an opportunity to see the duality of our lives. Our choices can divide us. Some can turn their noses up and lift their cigarettes to their pursed faces. They err on worldly expectations and are callous. Ignorance is the most poignant form of degradation. Do not ignore those in need because you are meant to make the difference. You clear the smoke pushed out by selfish lips and show them love. Take this man in your arms, meet him with what you have, and lead him where you will. Change the beggar and the stone-cold snobs.\</p>

<p>Get close, get personal, get big, and be remembered. Memories of love change lives.\</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>The bus on the way back to Marseille was just as bad as I expected. With a crooked neck and aching back, I made the commute to my apartment from the middle of the city. My first class of the week is in five hours.</p>
