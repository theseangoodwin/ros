Each hit comes one after another and swells after impact. I hold back every excuse because I know that now is the time to buck up and make positive changes. I want this, I’m hungry for it, so I will make it happen. I got the acceptance letter to the program; classes will get figured out; cue visions of money flying out of my pockets. I will take this time with the bulls and use it to my advantage. This one is mine, beneath my hand, and at the tips of my fingers.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>I’m conflicted. I’m waiting on too many emails, depending on too many people, and yet these five days have been the most productive of my entire trip. I don’t have the ability to control the other side, such as the hiring manager or the admissions counselor. Nevertheless, I move myself according to modern American standards. 
I will set myself up for either side of ‘success.’ Blacked out or white light, I’ll be there to make the most of it.</p>

                    <div class="content_div"><p>For the past 15 days, I haven’t written much. In fact, I am writing now because of something like shame. I don’t even want to have these moments in this book because I’ve been unwilling to admit my distraction. I’ve been spending too much money. My priorities have been a mixture of high productivity and vibrantly low choices. My sobriety is down the drain and not in a funny way. I’m sad. I’ve been laughing, crying, and bonding with friends. Although we’ve built strong relationships, I am skeptical about many things right now. I’m working to set up a great job when I get back to the U.S., I’m trying to take advantage of the summer I have between semesters, and I want to enjoy the time I have now, but I question how long these oddly-concocted friendships will last when they are mixed with alcohol and salt water.</p>

<p>I love the initiative, conviction, and ambition of the friends I’ve made on this journey. We got ourselves to France from all corners of the earth. Finally I’m not the sole decision maker in the group. We’ve been hiking, laughing, and chasing the sun as it sets past the Mediterranean water. We venture into the unknown and come out with something intangible: memories.</p>

<p>I’ve enjoyed my time in these moments, yet I look back and question their validity. 
I wake from a strange bed. Head spinning, I push myself to my feet and look down at the pool of vomit I am laying in. I wipe my arm across my face and pull some small chunks from my beard. My stomach sinks lower because I felt ill even before I opened my eyes. I am embarrassed, ashamed, and angry. Yet when they walk in and find me, they care for me. I doubt myself and feel like I will never live down this memory. I don’t want this and it is not who I am. My friends know this, yet I still hate it.</p>

<p>These now-brief moments of clear-headedness ask me to be critical. What I’ve done these past nights is out of character for me. What does this mean? I don’t think about who I am, but who can I become. What does this blurry vision make me and where will it lead me? I see that volatility in progress also includes negativity. 
Perhaps this is an indicator for caution as I move forward. I question whether this is what I’ve always wanted to see. Is this what it feels like to be “normal?” The parties I never went to and the stories I never told — are they the reality that exists on the backside of those flowery stories? I’ve visited the secret garden and its doesn’t smell as good as I’ve heard.</p>

                    <div class="content_div"><p>“Once upon a time in Spain there lived a bull and his name was Ferdinand. All of the other little bulls in the pasture loved to run around and butt their heads together, but not Ferdinand. Ferdinand preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. He had a favorite spot in the shade under a cork tree in the pasture. He would sit there all day long and sit just quietly and smell the flowers. 
His mother, who was a cow, asked him if he wanted to play and butt heads like the other little bulls but Ferdinand said no, he preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. His mother, who was very understanding, decided to just let him be happy there under the cork tree.</p>

<p>After a while Ferdinand grew into a big, strong bull. All of the other bulls in the field still ran around and butted their horns together. What they wanted more than anything in the world was to be chosen from the big bull fights in Madrid. But not Ferdinand, he preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers.</p>

<p>One day, a group of men from Madrid came to the pasture to choose a bull for the bull fight. All of the bulls were so excited and proudly showed off how tough they were by butting their heads together and acting very fierce. Ferdinand knew he would not be chosen so he left to go sit under his cork tree in the shade. 
Ferdinand was not very careful when he found a spot to sit down because without looking; he sat straight down on a bee! Now if you were a bee and a big bull like Ferdinand sat on you, what would you do? You would sting him right? Well that is exactly what this bee did. Ferdinand jumped up and ran around bucking, and jumping, and acting like he was crazy. The men in the funny hats were so excited; they knew they had found the toughest meanest bull in all of Spain.</p>

<p>So they took Ferdinand away to Madrid in a cart.</p>

<p>On the day of the big bull fight, the people in Madrid were so excited to see the toughest bull in all of Spain. Everyone waved around handkerchiefs and shouted loudly. The women all wore flowers in their hair. They even had a parade.
The parade led into the bull ring. First came the banderilleros who would stick the bull to make him mad. Then came the picadores who rode big horses and stuck the bull with a long spear to make him even madder. Then came the matador, the toughest of them all. The matador stuck the bull last of all. He was so excited to fight the toughest bull in all of Spain.</p>

<p>Last of all came the bull. And you know who that was don’t you? They took Ferdinand out into the center of the ring. As he rode in the cart, he smelled all of the beautiful flowers worn by the ladies in the crowd. He was amazed at all of the people there to watch him. When they let him out of the cart, the banderilleros, picadores, and matador were all very afraid.</p>

<p>Ferdinand slowly walked out of the cart and into the bull ring, sat down quietly and just smelled.</p>

<p>No one could get Ferdinand to fight. The banderilleros tried, the picadores tried, the matador tried but no one could get Ferdinand to fight. The matador was so upset that he started crying. He would not be able to show the people how brave and strong he was.</p>

<p>So they had to take Ferdinand home, back to the pasture. And for all I know, he is still there, under the cork tree, sitting just quietly smelling the flowers.”

Stare into speckled night sky
Atmospheric space</p>

<p>As the Sahara dunes pile around us, our caravan weaves between still waves. The rust color of the sand reflects into the gaseous air and a green mix comes back down to us. It lives among us and we among it.</p>

<p>I don’t trust the strangers here with me in the middle of the world.</p>

<p>The green gases and deep blue from the sky seep together into the densest night I’ve ever witnessed. I grip the rope tightly and painfully sway as the camel steps and sinks into the sand. Shifting from one side to the other, I lose balance while staring up into the abyss. I am tired and the darkness is difficult for us all to press through.</p>

<p>The night draws on as my eyelids get closer without me noticing. It isn’t until they clamp down on a view of the horizon that I realize the complete darkness. I’m too far in my own head or too lost in this cold desert sphere. This is what I’ve imagined when I lay awake at night.</p>

My elbow is resting in a small puddle on the table, but I ignore the dampness on my clothes. Instead, I focus on the conversation.</p>

<p>Conversations like these are few and far between. It’s expansive and rewarding and challenging all at the same time. I hate parties because I’m not good at being superficial. Thankfully, this conversation is anything but. The bass echoes off the tile floor and low-hanging ceiling. There’s loud yelling back and forth between crowded people, which doesn’t make it any easier to listen.</p>

<p>He travels on his own like I do. He’s seen much of Europe and its cities, and recognizes the value of exploring alone. Traveling like this is an expression of vulnerability that changes the way that others perceive you. However, traveling alone can change the course of your life only if you let it.</p>

<p>I want to be as vulnerable as possible, but I struggle to convey the emotions I feel in meeting someone from across the globe who is so similar to me. It’s a bizarre idea, but I could have this same conversation with myself. Our perspectives are very similar.</p>

<p>No matter what words I use to explain what two mirrors held face to face look like, I will never be able to express either the effect of seeing the glass, or what it feels like unless you’ve seen it yourself. Even if you’ve seen it, maybe your experience was different. Maybe you do know what infinity looks like, but it actually was a totally negligible moment in your life. Maybe you aren’t as impressed by theoretical distance as I am. So, it is true for this little act of storytelling. It consists of me repeating brief moments over and over in my head as I try to pick the perfect adjective to characterize the action, the speaker, or the moment. This book is my attempt to capture the experiences that have changed my life. I want so badly to share them with you. I know, however, that their power will be lost in translation from my eyes to your head, much like holding two mirrors held face to face.</p>

                    <div class="content_div"><p>Today has been my last day in Marseille. I cleaned my room and gathered my bags, now much more filled than they were when I arrived. I’ve packed my belongings around an elk antler that is slightly longer and taller than the size of my duffle bag. I got it from Paris and lovingly carried this oblong pointy thing back to my apartment by way of trains and buses, where it was ceremoniously rested atop my wardrobe. Now the antler nearly bursts the seams of my bag. I can only hope it will make it through security and back to the U.S. This evening I’ll leave Luminy and make my way to the edge of Marseille for my flight out of the country. My plane leaves at six in the morning; public transportation won’t be able to get me there that early, so I’ve decided to enjoy a night at the airport.</p>

<p>Until then however, I’ll spend my last few hours with my closest friends down the street. We make dinner, spend time reminiscing and laughing, and make plans to get back together in the States. I don’t really know what these friendships will look like back home. I don’t know if we’ll actually get back together, but I want to. I have cherished our time because the months we’ve spent together were radical moments in our lives. Our relationships are unique, unexpected, and empowering. Taiwo, Keha, and I sit on the balcony after dinner and watch the fluid sky change colors and set too quickly. We laugh through our evident sadness until the coastal breeze makes it too cold to stay outside. We bring the dishes in to clean, shutting the sliding glass door behind us.</p>

<p>I look back to where I began and am proud of my progress. I turn back to the glass door only to see the reflections of the wall, the foyer, and the front door to the apartment now behind me. I realize now that the only direction to go is forward.
The twins walk me to the familiar covered bench on the side of the street, and when the bus arrives, I leave.</p>
