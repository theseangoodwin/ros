<h1>A Reflection on Time From 37,001 Feet Above</h1>

<p>What is the significance of time if left undefined by color or by clockwork? If the shades are pulled down and the sun is gone, how do we measure the speed of our travel?</p>

<p>Time is relative and strikingly universal. It is simultaneously passing and permanent. If it relies on location, then crossing so many lines at once should be a paradox. Where does time end? I want to know so I can get back the six hours that were taken from me on this plane.</p>

<p>“We have twenty-five minutes until we land,” I hear the stewardess speak into the overhead. I listen for directions to my transfer, put my pen down, and start begin to organize my things.</p>
