<h1>7. The Irony of it All</h1>

<p>Martine speaks English. This is good. She also owns a food truck. This is very good. After we are introduced, the park official explains my situation. She hops out of the back of her truck, yells in beautiful French at the man behind the grill (her husband), and agrees to help. I thank my new friend the park official, and continue down the hill with Martine.</p>

<p>She is a friendly woman, very likeable and spunky. Physically, she has a medium height and short black hair, with blonde dyed sections. Her eyes command so much attention that her large, bright red, square frame glasses do not hinder their effect. We chat as best as we can. I, again, talk about where I came from, but this time I fill in the gaping holes of my French with English substitutes. I got a big reaction from her when I told her I arrived in the city only hours ago. We get to the gate of the apartment complex, which is locked thanks to the French lunch hour (I’d later learn that “hour” really means “two hours”). It seems that there is no office here that ‘works through lunch’. I appreciate the French commitment to food.</p>

<p>I offer to buy one of Martine’s sandwiches. She offers to let me use her phone to call the office after lunch. My time with Camion de Snack Luminy begins. 
She introduces me to several students eating her food. They are polite enough, indifferent I’d say, but rightfully so. I in no way can keep up with the rate of their lunch gossip, which was I’m sure was much more captivating to them than yet another lost American. While normal French conversation is maybe twice as fast as I need it to be to understand, their chatter was totally infeasible for me. I insert some bulky English sounds to the conversation and ask them about school. They text me a detailed digital map that is much better than that useless modern-art meets minimalist map I pulled from the train station. One of the students points out some key buildings on the screen and orients me toward the Aix-Marseille and Parc national des Calanques. I lift my head toward the buildings themselves and am impressed by my boldness. Unfortunately, the map has no relevance to my university, Kedge Business School. It stops just where I need it to begin, but it’s the thought that counts here I suppose. I thank them and get down to the business of lunch.</p>

<p>I scan the menu, flashing back to my French classroom in high school. I open the pages to the chapter on ordering food in French. It’s blank. Desperately seeking not to disappoint myself, or Martine for that matter, or even Madame Caraballo at Kellam High School, I look for anything on the menu I can fake my way through. “Le Royal, s’il vous Plait,” sloppily falls out of my mouth. The ‘R’ was at the front of my mouth and the ‘L’ created a dumb liaison that was not proper. To boot, an air of uncertainty carried the end of my message away in a helium balloon along with all my hopes of sounding competent. Martine grins, confirms, and begins to make what will be my first taste of French food on French soil.</p>

<p>She and her husband have owned their business and worked together in the truck for 27 years. They recently brought on their nephew, Kevin, after an unfortunate slew of allergies kicked him out of his old occupation (ah yes, the irony of a baker who can’t touch gluten).</p>

<p>If I believed in luck, I would say that it was not on his side and that it failed in getting me to class today. I spent a good hour with them, enjoyed some mildly underwhelming food, and thoroughly enjoyed the company. I’m excited to get back to the food truck tomorrow when I’ll be able to pay them back and speak more.</p>
