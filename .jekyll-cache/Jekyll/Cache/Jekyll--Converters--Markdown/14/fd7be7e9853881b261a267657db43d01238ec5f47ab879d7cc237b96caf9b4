I"%<p>I give and I take. I am not selfish. I am certainly not selfless. In the end, however, we are all some combination of both. Our presence in a space is a contribution to it as a whole. Whether we give ourselves to the moment and its potential glory or else shy away as a recluse is an argument, a conversation, which we can only introspectively conduct.</p>

<p>Pacifism is selfish. Excluding oneself from the human existence is denying others the ability to experience you. You, in all of your joys and passions, your mistakes and mediocrities, are worth sharing. Those who seem to have more value do, because they’ve committed to themselves the value they hold and continually seek. The only opposition to this worth is esteem: the ambiguous and sly shape-shifter meandering through our veins.</p>

<p>Selfish and Selfless. So close, yet so different. One is of kindness, of goodness, of purity, and of reflective compassion. The other is dark, draining, and abusive. Before we die, we need both. Conversely, an entity that hopes to live cannot be of either entirely. Why then do these hard-fought characteristics change as we enter a holy space? Voices are lowered, the extroverts diverge, and the rest of us gaze in awe. There is a dynamicism in the way a collection of walls also takes on this human dichotomy. As if living and breathing, I question if the building is passive or active, if it is conscientious and equilibrating. Perhaps it is not, and it is rather something entirely different. As if there isn’t any other choice, there may only be one alternative that lies in the space between. Regardless of millions of opinions, the Church is and always will be at the crux of the exchange between one and the other. It serves not as an institution’s distraction, but as the only way between good and evil.</p>
