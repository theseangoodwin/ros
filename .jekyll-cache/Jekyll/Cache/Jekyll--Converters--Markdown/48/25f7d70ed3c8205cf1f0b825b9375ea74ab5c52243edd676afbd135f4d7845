I"ÿ<p>Today I walk with purpose. Two days of life through a scavengerâ€™s eyes has caused me to warmly welcome adequacy back to my side along with some new friends. I was only able to quickly stop by Camion de Snack to repay my debt to Martine and to pick up a water bottle before class. I make my way to my last class of the week, which also happens to be the first one Iâ€™ve been able to attend. Just outside the classroom, a scattered student mass begins to gather, waiting for the room to be available. Now is the first time that Iâ€™ve had a real chance to observe the smartly dressed and put-together typecast that is the French student body. Ladies and gentlemen, they care about the way they look. No â€˜comfyâ€™ clothes for lounging in lecture halls here. Dudes are wearing fitted slacks, tees, and the classic euro side-bags, while the women are completely blowing the American girls out of the water. Absolutely beautiful. And even more beautiful is the way they carry themselves. I turn to a relatably styled classmate next to me and introduce myself. She is tall, has mysterious eyes, and the persona to match. She is from Canada so of course I am the one who breaks the French a couple of moments into the conversation. She has an air about her that I wholeheartedly respect. Something like a subdued congeniality that asks me to appreciate the smallest details of her mannerisms. Her smile is honest and tells me that she appreciates our time together. Her name is Cynthia and I appreciated our time together as well.</p>
