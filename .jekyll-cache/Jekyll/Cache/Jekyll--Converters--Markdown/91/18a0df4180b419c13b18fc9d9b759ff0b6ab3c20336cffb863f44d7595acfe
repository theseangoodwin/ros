I"Å<p>I spent the second half of the day with new people. Iâ€™m a young American armed with a camera who relies on charisma and spontaneity. One photo-op that I couldnâ€™t pass up resulted in my meeting Morgan and Bolgarov right outside of the city walls. They were on their bikes in front of the stone city ramparts. I saw them marking up the garden terraces and modern cement underpass near the highway. They welcomed my camera and my simple French.</p>
