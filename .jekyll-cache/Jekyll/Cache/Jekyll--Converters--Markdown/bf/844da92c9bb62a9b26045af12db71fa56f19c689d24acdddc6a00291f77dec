I"ú	<p>For the past 15 days, I havenâ€™t written much. In fact, I am writing now because of something like shame. I donâ€™t even want to have these moments in this book because Iâ€™ve been unwilling to admit my distraction. Iâ€™ve been spending too much money. My priorities have been a mixture of high productivity and vibrantly low choices. My sobriety is down the drain and not in a funny way. Iâ€™m sad. Iâ€™ve been laughing, crying, and bonding with friends. Although weâ€™ve built strong relationships, I am skeptical about many things right now. Iâ€™m working to set up a great job when I get back to the U.S., Iâ€™m trying to take advantage of the summer I have between semesters, and I want to enjoy the time I have now, but I question how long these oddly-concocted friendships will last when they are mixed with alcohol and salt water.</p>

<p>I love the initiative, conviction, and ambition of the friends Iâ€™ve made on this journey. We got ourselves to France from all corners of the earth. Finally Iâ€™m not the sole decision maker in the group. Weâ€™ve been hiking, laughing, and chasing the sun as it sets past the Mediterranean water. We venture into the unknown and come out with something intangible: memories.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve enjoyed my time in these moments, yet I look back and question their validity. 
I wake from a strange bed. Head spinning, I push myself to my feet and look down at the pool of vomit I am laying in. I wipe my arm across my face and pull some small chunks from my beard. My stomach sinks lower because I felt ill even before I opened my eyes. I am embarrassed, ashamed, and angry. Yet when they walk in and find me, they care for me. I doubt myself and feel like I will never live down this memory. I donâ€™t want this and it is not who I am. My friends know this, yet I still hate it.</p>

<p>These now-brief moments of clear-headedness ask me to be critical. What Iâ€™ve done these past nights is out of character for me. What does this mean? I donâ€™t think about who I am, but who can I become. What does this blurry vision make me and where will it lead me? I see that volatility in progress also includes negativity. 
Perhaps this is an indicator for caution as I move forward. I question whether this is what Iâ€™ve always wanted to see. Is this what it feels like to be â€œnormal?â€ The parties I never went to and the stories I never told â€” are they the reality that exists on the backside of those flowery stories? Iâ€™ve visited the secret garden and its doesnâ€™t smell as good as Iâ€™ve heard.</p>
