I"Ã<p>The patriotism and European sense of self is far greater than what is accepted in the United States. I admire the French peopleâ€™s passion. It creates content rather than limits it. It enables movement beyond terror and embraces strength in numbers. I will welcome fear and turn it into something bigger than its maker intended. 
The righteous citizens are angered by the conspiracy for the greater good, mass madness, and for political gain.</p>
