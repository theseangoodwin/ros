I"¡<p>Itâ€™s late and I watch the sun set with disappointment. I still donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m staying tonight. I may bring myself to find a place, but Iâ€™ll probably convince myself otherwise. I am pushed onto the streets against my will just like I thought and dreamed. I face the west. Despite what I want, ambition keeps me to my word. â€œItâ€™s one night,â€ I tell myself. Itâ€™s one out of a thousand that the homeless face. My internal conflict switches sides quickly and I lean back and forth. The eight euros that I spent on my hostel for the night weigh heavily on my mind. Itâ€™s cold, itâ€™s not safe, and someone could steal my backpack if I fall asleep. If my phone and wallet were taken from me, I would feel it in the pit of my stomach for months to come. The money and documentation that were so difficult to obtain would be a nightmare to replace. I realize that I am risking more than just my possessions.</p>
