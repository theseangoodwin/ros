I"ð<p>Here we all are, a makeshift group of three Germans, two Finns, an Australian, and two Americans, cramped in a hotel room. The windows are open to the chilly red night sky and I hear the street sounds below. Iâ€™m cooking with Lucas while Brent fills glasses of wine across the two joined tables we pushed together. Itâ€™s loud and thereâ€™s music in the background.</p>

<p>I found a spot in this group while writing at the port in Marseille. They are all kind enough, and have personalities that pique my interest. Tomorrow we will ski the French Alps together, but some will be more successful at it than others. For now, I will enjoy a wide conversation that is friendly enough, but laced with sharp opinions. Strong patriotism exists, but Iâ€™ve not been convinced that itâ€™s warranted at such an emphatic level. Maybe this is just my ignorance shining through.</p>

<p>Although weâ€™re tightly squeezed into this kitchen, the conversation flows naturally despite our very apparent differences.</p>
