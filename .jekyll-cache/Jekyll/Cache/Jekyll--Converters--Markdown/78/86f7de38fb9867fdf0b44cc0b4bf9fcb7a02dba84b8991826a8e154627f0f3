I"Å<p>I am writing about the nervous thoughts in my head. After my departure was delayed a week because of visa complications, I finally have the time to refocus and muster my attention. Sometimes I forget that I am never alone. My desire for a better life pushes me to do the best that I can in the present moment. When I fail, I tear myself apart believing that Iâ€™ve sacrificed some unknown addition to the future. I have been asked to become more dependent; to piece myself together from my innately flawed humanity. I try.</p>

<p>I ask for humility, for honesty, and for a particular openness to vulnerability: to acknowledge the past and to be present for the future. You and I are closer than Iâ€™ve ever felt before now that Iâ€™m losing all senses of familiarity. I tread lightly into the water and try to imagine emerging on top on the other side. You and I: <span class="blackletter">Communion</span>.<br />
<br />
My school, jobs, friendships, meetings, and focus all combine together in this moment. Right here, right now. Iâ€™ve worked hard to get myself into this seat. Now is not the time to let my nerves get the best of me. I am not scared, but I do question whether this is too good to be true. I am skeptical. I am jaded. I write to leave my baggage on the tarmac and I also write to pick up my few belongings in order to push the boundaries of character.</p>
