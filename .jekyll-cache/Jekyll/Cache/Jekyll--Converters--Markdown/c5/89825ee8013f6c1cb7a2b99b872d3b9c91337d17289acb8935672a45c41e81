I"`<p>Why is it that I speak better French alone in my room before bed? I keep myself awake at night because Iâ€™ve gotten into the habit of running through the day and its situations in my head before sleeping. Except here I can quickly think of the vocabulary I forgot during the day and am able to articulate something that resembles a literate response. Whether here or there, should I not be the same regardless of location? And now that this one variable has changed, I ask myself: what value does location actually hold?</p>

<p><br />
I want so badly to speak like they do and so I will eventually.</p>
