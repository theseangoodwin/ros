I"ó<p>Felicity lives
Stare into speckled night sky
Atmospheric space</p>

<p>As the Sahara dunes pile around us, our caravan weaves between still waves. The rust color of the sand reflects into the gaseous air and a green mix comes back down to us. It lives among us and we among it.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t trust the strangers here with me in the middle of the world.</p>

<p>The green gases and deep blue from the sky seep together into the densest night Iâ€™ve ever witnessed. I grip the rope tightly and painfully sway as the camel steps and sinks into the sand. Shifting from one side to the other, I lose balance while staring up into the abyss. I am tired and the darkness is difficult for us all to press through.</p>

<p>The night draws on as my eyelids get closer without me noticing. It isnâ€™t until they clamp down on a view of the horizon that I realize the complete darkness. Iâ€™m too far in my own head or too lost in this cold desert sphere. This is what Iâ€™ve imagined when I lay awake at night.</p>
