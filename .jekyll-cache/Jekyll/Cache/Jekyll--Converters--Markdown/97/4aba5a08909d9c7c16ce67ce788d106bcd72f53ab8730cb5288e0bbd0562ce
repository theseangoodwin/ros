I"h<p>Martine speaks English. This is good. She also owns a food truck. This is very good. After we are introduced, the park official explains my situation. She hops out of the back of her truck, yells in beautiful French at the man behind the grill (her husband), and agrees to help. I thank my new friend the park official, and continue down the hill with Martine.</p>

<p>She is a friendly woman, very likeable and spunky. Physically, she has a medium height and short black hair, with blonde dyed sections. Her eyes command so much attention that her large, bright red, square frame glasses do not hinder their effect. We chat as best as we can. I, again, talk about where I came from, but this time I fill in the gaping holes of my French with English substitutes. I got a big reaction from her when I told her I arrived in the city only hours ago. We get to the gate of the apartment complex, which is locked thanks to the French lunch hour (I’d later learn that “hour” really means “two hours”). It seems that there is no office here that ‘works through lunch’. I appreciate the French commitment to food.</p>
