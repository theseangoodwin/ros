I"®<p>â€œOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. <span class="blackletter">Our deepest fear</span> is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, â€˜Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, [exceptional]?â€™ <a>Actually, who are you not to be?</a> â€¦ Your <strike>playing small</strike> does not serve the world. <em>There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wonâ€™t feel insecure around you.</em> <span class="sans">We are all meant to shine, as children do. (We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. Itâ€™s not just in some of us; itâ€™s in everyone.) And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.</span> As we are liberated from our own fear, <span class="blackletter">our presence automatically liberates others.</span>â€</p>

<p>â€”Marianne Williamson</p>
