I"S<p>I bought my train ticket and made plans to get to Avignon yesterday evening. It was a spur-of-the moment decision, the likes of which I don’t normally make. I stress myself out.</p>

<p>I found some comfort in the tight schedule I made. I planned out every minute from wake at 5:30 until 23:00. Throughout this trip, I would cross out my trophy schedule line by line and taped it to my wall in remembrance of another slightly greater, successful venture. When I pull into the city across the Rhone River Bridge, I see the city’s outer ramparts and the Palais du Papes towering above the city’s dull orange tiled roofs.</p>

<p>Mass was in the Avignon Basilica. The golden altar, the oil paintings, the stained glass, the incense, the language, the sounds of the organ and its single unfortunately detuned key used only in the recessional hymn, culminated to an oddly memorable and transportive experience. The day, like the city, pairs modernity and history in a way that is entirely unique to Avignon. In the blue-orange morning light, I explored the Palace of the Popes which is surrounded by 14th century architecture. I am impressed by the power of the Church, its ability to influence daily life, and its ability to make me feel small; to remind me that I am single being among many. Like ants piling dirt, this massive palace was built by 850 people in 20 years. Each individual’s story and strength are more than mine, and yet all these differences came together to build one brilliant monument that attempted to glorify God. I reflect on the radical movements in music that the Church inspired at the time; specifically, Guillaume de Machaut and Francesco Landini’s push for the new arts and polyphony. I think about living in a world centered around the Church. It’s a theoretically beautiful idea, but when I apply it to reality, I am conflicted</p>
