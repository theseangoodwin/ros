I"≥<p>‚ÄúMy face is shining upon you, beaming out peace that transcends your feeble understanding. A sea of problems surrounds you, but you are face to face with Me, your peace. As long as you focus on me, you are safe. If you gaze too long at the myriad problems around you, you will sink under the weight of your burdens. 
The closer you live to Me, the safer you are. Circumstances around you are undulating, and there are treacherous-looking waves in the distance. Fix your eyes on Me, because I never change. By the time those waves reach you, they will have shrunk to the proportions of My design. I am always beside you, helping you face today‚Äôs waves. The future is a phantom.‚Äù</p>
