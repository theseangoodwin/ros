I"h<p>I give and I take. I am not selfish. I am certainly not selfless. In the end, however, we are all some combination of both. Our presence in a space is a contribution to it as a whole. Whether we give ourselves to the moment and its potential glory or else shy away as a recluse is an argument, a conversation, which we can only introspectively conduct.</p>
