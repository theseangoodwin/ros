I"ÿ<p>Sunday comes with remarkable beauty. I make my way to the port and eat at my new favorite restaurant: Au Vieux Port. I canâ€™t resist the simplicity of enjoying good food while looking out to the Mediterranean morning of Marseille. In celebration of the sublime, I welcome the finer breads, cheeses, meats, and vegetables into my life: my truest friends. Thinly-sliced saussison, mozzarella, and tomato, topped with salt, pepper, and arguably the most enticing house-mixed olive oil Iâ€™ve ever had. Beside the plate lies thick and fresh whole-grain, perfectly crunchy bread with a thin spread of silky smooth butter. Arugula, olives, and brie cheese are on the other side of the plate topped with the restaurantâ€™s olive oil and some thick balsamic vinegar.</p>
