I"ù<p>â€œThis old parish protects me and a few others from the howling winds that wail just outside the creaky wooden doors. My canvas shoes are wet and my hip pains me through every step. It is dusk on the third Thursday that Iâ€™ve been here in France. The overcast sky and watery streets creep into the cracked church and dampen the walls. Since they cannot force their way in entirely, I imagine this is the most dreary ambiance they can muster. The dominant colors around me are black and blue and stone gray. The chill and hollow empty space are causing the church to be blustery and cold. I kneel on the smooth rounded bar at my feet and let the discomfort in my bones distract the rest of my body from the cold. I reflect on the days that have passed.</p>
