I"7<p>Throughout the day, I recall the night. I realize that if I want the life I imagine in my head, and if I want it to stay, Iâ€™m going to have to fight for it. The dark will try to take it. The cold will bite and the headlights will stare me down. The time in the sun is well worth the hours in the dark.</p>
