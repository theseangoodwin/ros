I"Ë<p>The more I think about falling into the water at Vieux Port, the more I tell myself not to. But the more I tell myself not to, the closer I get to falling. The more I imagine jumping from the lookout above the city, the more scared I become. I am scared of myself and what I am capable of doing. Good or bad, there is an intense dichotomy to achievement. I step up to the ledge of my balcony and look below. One day, what if I choose to let myself go?</p>
