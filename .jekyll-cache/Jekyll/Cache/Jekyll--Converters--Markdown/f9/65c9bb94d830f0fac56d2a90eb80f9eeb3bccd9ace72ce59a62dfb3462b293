I"N<p>I can see the future. My relationships with Matthew and Daniel have incredible potential. Day by day, the role models I looked up to are becoming my equals. I can see the ones that I hold close 10 years down the road, but that future feels like it will happen tomorrow. It’s the day I return to the States, in the moment we see each other again. The future is happy, healthy, loving, and supportive. It’s something substantial and complete.</p>

<p>I make way to Nevers in the French countryside. My destination is the resting place of Saint Bernadette, the incorruptible saint.</p>
