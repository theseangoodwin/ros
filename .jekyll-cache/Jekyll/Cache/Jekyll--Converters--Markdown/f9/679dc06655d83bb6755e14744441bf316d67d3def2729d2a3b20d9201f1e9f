I"<p>I know we won’t survive 
I swear we won’t make it out alive</p>

<p>be afraid 
don’t you know what lies underneath 
the fabric that never quite covered it?</p>

<p>your feral mind will decide to let it all go 
I can see right through your empty facade</p>

<p>have we all just gone to the dogs? 
it’s not safe but we’re still moving on 
and those so-called diamond minds continue to 
lead us three steps back</p>

<p>have we all just gone to the dogs? 
I know they are going to leave nothing for anyone
so if you don’t mind</p>

<p>go and hide your darling pearls 
collapse, will your body fail you? 
collapse into yourself 
now you’ve caved in 
the same thing we all do</p>

<p>and he said, she said 
that belief was a cemetery 
it’s a shallow hole where suckers lay 
and I won’t waste my time with it 
no, I will not take any part of it</p>

<p>so if you don’t mind</p>

<p>go and hide your darling pearls 
collapse, will your body fail you? 
collapse into yourself 
now you’ve caved in 
the same thing we always do</p>
