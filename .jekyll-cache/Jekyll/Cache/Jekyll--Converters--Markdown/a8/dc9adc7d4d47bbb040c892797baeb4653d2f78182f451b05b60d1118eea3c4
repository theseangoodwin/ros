I"¼<p>The hardest part is arriving, now I am finally here. Iâ€™ve worked diligently to make my own way to this country and now it is reciprocating back to me. It has given me a part of itself to call my own, it makes me feel safe, and it allows me to recover after Iâ€™ve given the day all I have. While there undoubtedly are things around me that will fall apart, I now know that even the space above my bed is helping me to build my dreams.</p>
