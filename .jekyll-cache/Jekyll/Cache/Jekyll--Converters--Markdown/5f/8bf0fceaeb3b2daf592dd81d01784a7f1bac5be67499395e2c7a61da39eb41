I"<p>death, pattern, fault
come to us all</p>

<p>shape, pattern, color</p>

<p>god cut God because you can
repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating 
worship, pattern, fall
death to us all</p>

<p>gone in the blink of an eye
everything I had fell behind me 
I move forward, changing, because I have to</p>

<p>into the dyebath, I start down
into the murk liquid mixed with bird shit 
it stains my legs, it clings to my skin
claims it’ll never let go, even after death</p>

<p>the color marks me
proof to see who I was and who I will be</p>

<p>I lower myself in to my neck
until my neck is slowly, slowly, 
the final divide between the past and the present</p>

<p>The red meets my eyes, everything red
Red like I’ve never seen before</p>

<p>I submerge and I submit</p>
