I"£<p>After making several disjointed inquiries about transportation, I finally arrive on campus. I realize that when I say, â€˜I arrive on campus,â€™ it sounds like I know what Iâ€™m doing and where Iâ€™m heading now that Iâ€™ve come. This is just not true. American colleges and French colleges are very different. America is different than France. Streets, cars,maps, the way you get out of the metro, the signs and the symbols and the colors are jarringly different in France than they are in the United States of America. These vibrant reminders, coupled with the fact that Iâ€™ve been travelling for over 20 hours, are proving to be an absolutely wonderful challenge.</p>
