I"X<p>I am writing about the nervous thoughts in my head. After my departure was delayed a week because of visa complications, I finally have the time to refocus and muster my attention. Sometimes I forget that I am never alone. My desire for a better life pushes me to do the best that I can in the present moment. When I fail, I tear myself apart believing that I’ve sacrificed some unknown addition to the future. I have been asked to become more dependent; to piece myself together from my innately flawed humanity. I try.</p>

<p>I ask for humility, for honesty, and for a particular openness to vulnerability: to acknowledge the past and to be present for the future. You and I are closer than I’ve ever felt before now that I’m losing all senses of familiarity. I tread lightly into the water and try to imagine emerging on top on the other side.</p>

<h3>You and I: <span class="blackletter">Communion</span>.</h3>
<p><br />
<br />
My school, jobs, friendships, meetings, and focus all combine together in this moment. Right here, right now. I’ve worked hard to get myself into this seat. Now is not the time to let my nerves get the best of me. I am not scared, but I do question whether this is too good to be true. I am skeptical. I am jaded. I write to leave my baggage on the tarmac and I also write to pick up my few belongings in order to push the boundaries of character.</p>
