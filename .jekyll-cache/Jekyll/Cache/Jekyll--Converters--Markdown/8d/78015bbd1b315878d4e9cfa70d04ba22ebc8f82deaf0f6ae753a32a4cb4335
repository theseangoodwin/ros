I"5<p>The French language is not some club to be held in an exclusive manner. The popular perspective claiming that French should only be spoken perfectly creates insurmountable barriers for those without fluency. I live in a country where I am not fluent in the dominant language and have to address this confusing mental block in order to survive. I hope others facing similar hurdles do the same. <br />

Language may be accessed at many levels, but when I first saw French on a chalkboard, I was consistently overwhelmed. While I learned it quickly then, I did not feel much passion for it. Piece by piece, I now learn how to use the classroom vocabulary that I once wrote on worksheets for a red marker check. Whether it be mere interest or the ordinary pursuit of living well here, I have rekindled the fire to overcome the learning curve. I am not proficient, nor do I possess the flexibility of good syntax, but I am getting things done, which is the most basic purpose of communication. What more could I ask for? Technically nothing unless I use a translator.</p>
