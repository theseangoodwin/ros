I"Á<blockquote>â€œOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. <span class="blackletter">Our deepest fear</span> is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, <u>Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, \[fabulous]</u>? 

<u><b>Actually, who are you not to be?</b></u> There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wonâ€™t feel insecure around you. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, <span class="blackletter">our presence automatically liberates others</span>.â€</blockquote>
