I"`<p>out with the old 
you’ve grown 
or so you say you have</p>

<p>the news does not shock you 
your skin is too thick 
the crevice is too deep</p>

<p>and as you stand at the edge 
it takes your breath from your chest</p>

<p>take back every word 
in the off chance I’m dead wrong 
tell me what’s out there</p>

<p>in with the new, it’s here 
like it or not 
make some space between 
those pretty little ears 
it’s all you’ve got left in your head</p>

<p>the flux and the waves to a world receding 
between the lines and outside of our minds 
and I’ve nothing left to lose</p>

<p>prove to me I’m a liar 
prove to me I’m alive</p>

<p>take this place back to black and white 
because I’m tired of the grey 
one worn out scene with no distinction,
I just want to see you</p>

<p>can these legs prove to me 
we’ve overtaken most everything</p>

<p>for real, for hate, 
for the lost and the saints 
for the love of a night, 
and a barren sunrise</p>

<p>take back every word 
in the off chance I’m dead wrong 
tell me what is out there</p>

<p>prove to me I’m a liar 
prove to me I’m alive</p>
