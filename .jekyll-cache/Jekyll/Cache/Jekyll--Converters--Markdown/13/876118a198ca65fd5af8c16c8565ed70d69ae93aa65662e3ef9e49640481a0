I"í<p>I know I am so hollow 
just an empty cave 
pit of my heart, dark 
then treachery came</p>

<p>fear dark 
wake in time 
red eyes to realize</p>

<p>thereâ€™s a safe sound within your voice 
I get up here close because I want to know 
what itâ€™s like to be yours and all for you</p>

<p>teach me to become love</p>

<p>slowly I start to burn 
a small flame 
came and pushed back the black putting it in its place</p>

<p>I know Iâ€™m so hollow 
an empty cave 
pit of my heart, dark, then majesty came</p>

<p>fear God 
open your heart 
your eyes are mine 
when I realize</p>

<p>thereâ€™s a safe space between your arms 
I get up, stand up, because I want you to know 
that I choose to be yours and all for you</p>

<p>teach me to become love</p>
