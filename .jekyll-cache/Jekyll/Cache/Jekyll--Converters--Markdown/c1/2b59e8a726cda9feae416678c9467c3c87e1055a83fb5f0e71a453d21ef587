I"¾<p>Aldo video-called me two nights ago for an interview. He was gathering quotes for a print design project.</p>

<p>â€œWhat are you afraid of?â€ he asked.</p>

<p>The look in his eye wasnâ€™t typical and it was clear that these answers meant something to both of us. I fear the things I donâ€™t know. Language barriers, the â€˜firstâ€™ of many experiences, and the ways people will react. They are all beyond my grasp and out of my control. I know my capabilities and after perceiving the problems ahead, I prepare myself as well as I can before the next obstacle overwhelms me. I grow because I fear being at the mercy of the waves. They stop for no one and I hate banking on special treatment.</p>
