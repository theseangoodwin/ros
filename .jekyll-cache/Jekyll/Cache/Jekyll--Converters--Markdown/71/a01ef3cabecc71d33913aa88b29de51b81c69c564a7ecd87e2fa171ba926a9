I"©<p>What is this pit in my stomach? This mixing air and space? Itâ€™s incapacitating anxiety building on top of something. It swells to infect my lungs and I gasp for air. My chest is tight and reluctant to lift. When I lie in bed at night, breathing is hard and my head is twisting into some complicated shape I canâ€™t define. My body has corners that come together to make impossible intersections. Their existence cannot be outside of my imagination, but I am conviced otherwise.<br />
<br />
I am changing, perhaps faster than I can take and faster than I can understand. Here, then there, I am made from pieces coming from all sides bound to a central point. Itâ€™s complicated and out of my control. What do I do with knowledge that canâ€™t be defined? What is to be said about new and indescribable existence? Although I see the contortion, I am confused; distracted, rather, by the arms and legs spewing from the thick knot.</p>
