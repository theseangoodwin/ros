I"Ö<p>â€œWhat is it about the nature of odd or even that influences our minds? I am told to always design in odd numbers. However, we sometimes need elements to stick out, and at other times, we want to blend in, especially now in foreign territory. The holiness of the number seven is so close to the menace of six yet infinitely more superior. We try our entire lives to bridge the gap of one and many canâ€™t. The love of three parts created a single One, to come onto Earth to demystify the path leading from one to the other. Simplicity, I fear, makes things more difficult. Knowing the odds youâ€™re up against reveals the opposition we face. For someone like myself, that opposition often seems too large to overcome.</p>
