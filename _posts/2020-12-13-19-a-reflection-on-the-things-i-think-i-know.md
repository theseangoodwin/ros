A seagull that sounds just like my cat on top of the Frioul Archipelago; a new friend whose mannerisms are like Ian’s; a short elderly woman’s silhouette like my Grandmother’s; a laugh from the corner of the room that sounds just like my mother’s; a sentence that can only come from Aldo’s mind; the bread Kristin vividly described to me; the sunset I’ve dreamt of before; playing music in a circle of friends; the driver of the ambulance turning the corner past Mont De Lans (I swear it was Kez); walking onto a city block that looked like the first French dream I had; Deafheaven from a previous conversation; Becca; Danny’s blue eyes and bridge piercing; a chessboard; stripping a sheep head; the dead branch I moved into my room; Yohji Yamamoto; Helvetica everywhere; deep purple lipstick; Frnkiero andthe Cellabration; a cocker-spaniel in the park; playing with swans on the water’s edge; the smell of tears; the taste in your mouth after waking from a nap; Dajung’s criticism; the smell of a bonfire; the sand in my shoes; treks through a damp forest; ‘thy holy hand grenade; ’the bright side of life; deep blue eyes; a C minor arpeggio; Brazil; taboo words; the mail office; Wallid; Keha; Kalia; mint tea; the Medina; the rooster and the sunrise; bones; the smell of the tannery and leather workings; babushka; Vans; bittersweet friendship; good byes; and arrivals. 

These are the things I think I know. They are scattered moments that, in the middle of nowhere, remind me of something familiar and inspired convincing flashbacks of home.
