oh God, what have I done?
I love everything that I’ve lost

burn your pretense to bone
even and opposite consequences 
walking around like some kind of big shot
well let me tell you something when push comes to shove you’re not

feeble, breed not
we’ll take it back in over time 
little, brittle, hollow, and low
let’s see how far these fine fools will go

I know you like the rope around your neck 

oh my God, what have I done?
everything I loved, everything I’ve lost

so raise your predecessors from the grave
get tough with even and opposite consequences
 
I wake from a dream
I see a space between the trees
and the waves crashing down
upon the watercolor sea
and from it rises a part of me
I never wanted to see

there’s a light in the back of this house
and there’s gasoline poured over everything
strike a match and watch them burn 

a role adversary happens to be 
what everybody wants to see

I tell myself I won’t let this happen again 
because we are fed line after line, 
being told that these environments 
are not made with malicious intent, 
they don’t want to see you happy, 
they don’t want to see you succeed, 
he counts on you being broken, isolated, and cold, 
that’s the only chance he has to get what he wants
