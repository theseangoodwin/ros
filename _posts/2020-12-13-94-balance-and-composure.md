Prudence moves us to choose in every instance the best means for achieving our goals. 

Disbelief > Prudence < Fantasy

Justice inclines us the will to give others at all times what they deserve.

Indifference > Justice < False belief

Fortitude strengthens the mind to choose good, allowing it to be overcome by fear; even the fear of death. Fear of effort, risk and failure, criticism and of ridicule.

Ignorance > Fortitude < Dread 

Temperance moderates the attractions toward pleasure and keeps us within limits. This idea relates to selfâ€“control.

Insensitivity > Temperance < Gluttony
