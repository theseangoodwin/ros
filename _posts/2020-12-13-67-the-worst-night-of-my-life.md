That was the worst night of my life. Alone on the other side of the globe. Isolated in a cold, closed room. The sweat of nerves and the chill of the air leave me so uncomfortable in the boxy apartment bedroom. I keep my eyes from the shadowy windows. The balcony door creaks open, followed by the kitchen door. The corners swallow black and Iâ€™ve never wanted to be alone so badly.
