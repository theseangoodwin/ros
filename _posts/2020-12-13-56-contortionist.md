<a class="E56_I1">What is this pit in my stomach?</a> This mixing air and space? It’s incapacitating anxiety building on top of something. It swells to infect my lungs and I gasp for air. <a class="E56_I2">My chest is tight and reluctant to lift.</a> When I lie in bed at night, breathing is hard and my head is twisting into some complicated shape I can’t define. <blockquote class="E56_Q3"> My body has corners that come together to make impossible intersections.</blockquote> Their existence cannot be outside of my imagination, but I am convinced otherwise.\

I am changing, perhaps faster than I can take and faster than I can understand. Here, then there, I am made from pieces coming from all sides bound to a central point. It’s complicated and out of my control. What do I do with knowledge that can’t be defined? What is to be said about new and indescribable existence? Although I see the contortion, I am confused; distracted, rather, by the arms and legs spewing from the thick knot.
