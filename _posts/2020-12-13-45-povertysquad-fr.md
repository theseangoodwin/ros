I make my way through a grocery store collecting drinks, oranges, saussison, and pain au chocolate for the two homeless men I passed. As I’m writing this, I realize that I’ve picked out the foods I would have really liked to have eaten, which I’m sure has some metaphorical value. When I grab them quickly off the shelves, I recall my fast. I realize why I’ve been given that extra bunch of bananas as well. I put everything in one plastic bag and carry two large drinks in my hands. I put my camera away, fighting the temptation to capture their look in photograph. Two years of social justice education at my university has taught me to be especially intentional in situations like this. I am no savior. I return to their place and offer what I’ve brought.

Unsure of what language to begin in, I goofily hop between French and English and am relieved when English is fluently spoken back. When I eventually sit down with them on the concrete, I am careful to present myself as authentically as I can. I am not nervous because of them; I’m nervous because there is a gross stigma about people that live on the streets. It’s a barrier that puts them in a terrible light, as if they are some underground population of alter-races. I do my best to avoid these ideas as the conversation begins.

Ed, the more extroverted of the two, is the first to welcome me. His German face has over a thousand intricacies that tell the story of a lifetime. There is a scar or a deep wrinkle (I can’t quite tell which) on his skin that runs laterally across his face. His right nostril is pierced and he has ink just beneath his cheek skin in some befuddled shape that lost its corners with time. Both ears are crudely pierced and the stretched lobe on the left side has been torn from a fist fight. He tells me that a shark bone used to hang there from when he was fishing for sharks in Florida. Push came to shove, and he lost his job there nearly 11 years ago. When he was unemployed, he crossed the U.S. by foot in four and a half years. His wiry red beard thinly fills his face and his laugh is more of an alarming cackle. I’m not sure how the laugh came to sound that way over the years, but it seems as if it has taken time and intentionality to perfect. I never thought this laugh existed outside of TV.

Danny, the blued-eyed Dutchman, looks like God. The triangle made from his eyes and the metal bar that runs through the bridge of his nose makes the clearest window to divinity I’ve ever seen. In this moment, I begin to think about the differences between circumstance and divine intervention. For the first hour he quietly stayed back against the wall, watching the two of us. There is a bottle of red wine close to his side along with the new sack of foods I brought in the corner behind him. He just existed. Some makeshift metal rings buried in his facial hair ran through his nose and bottom lip, which I didn’t notice at first. Brown-blond hair falls to the side beneath the brim of his hat. He is dark, shady, and very selective with what he’s said to me so far. He speaks his mother tongue, along with French, English, Portuguese, German, and soon Italian. The two of them have plans to migrate to Italy by the end of the year. Danny offers me wine from their bottle and a cigarette. I deny both. He asks two young ladies passing by for a cigarette. They initially declined and continued past us, but then returned moments later with two cigarettes. One to share, and one to save.

“And you don’t smoke?” Ed asks again. 
“No,” I respond. 
“Good,” he says. “Don’t start.” 
“Unless you don’t like who you are,” Danny calmly chimes in.

Ed finishes his thought, “Waking up in the morning without cigarettes is worse than dying. Your body collapses on itself during the night. Like oysters clinging to your insides, they grind up against you and you can’t breathe until you smoke two or three and hack the shit up.” 
“A fucking bastard drug that changes who you are.” 
...
“You play chess?”

And so Ed and I begin our game. He carefully lifts a tiny plastic chessboard from his possessions and sets it between us. I notice that the black set is missing a knight that has been replaced by one of his teeth. It’s rounded and worn, with a silver filling in the cavity. This set is placed in front of him and the white set is initially placed closer to me. He picks a piece from each side, closes his fists, and mixes them. He then holds his outstretched arms out before me. I touch his right hand to reveal a black piece in his palm. He rotates the board and gives me the black pieces and the tooth.

When the game begins, I get a feel for what I am up against. Ed is a smart, forward-thinking strategist that knows how to prepare for the future. His finger twitches as he counts out the moves I will eventually make. I know the game is in his hands for the majority of the time, but I try not to let him know that. As the game progresses, there is a short period where the control shifts from his side to mine, but eventually moves back to his. I become less focused and lose my confidence in chess. I get distracted and pay more attention to the situation. This hour of quiet introspection hunched over the board is familiar and easy. I find comfort on the ground in Marseille watching the people pass by, towering above us. 
He makes a huge diagonal move from across the board and takes a key rook of mine. I disappointedly exhale. “It’s still the same game!” Danny adds, looking at me like a father or a coach. I feel cared for. The oceanfront wind moves through the buildings like a wind tunnel. Exposed and stripped of measure, I feel solidarity between strangers and have found value in this uncommon situation.

I look back down to the board and continue to make moves. A calculated “check” falls from Ed’s mouth. “It’s over, but we’re going to play until the bloody end.” And we do. We play until I lose. Grins turn up on our faces. I shake Ed’s hand and admit to defeat in a well - deserved victory.

Two young French girls pass by and ask if we are brothers. “To some extent, yea.”
