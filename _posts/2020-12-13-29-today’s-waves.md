<blockquote class="E29_Q1">The future is a phantom and I am shining out at you, beaming out peace that transcends your little understanding.</blockquote> A sea of problems surrounds you, but you and I are face to face, in peace. As long as you focus on me, you are safe. If you gaze too long at the myriad problems around you, you will sink under the weight of your burdens.\
\
The closer you live to me, the safer you are. Circumstances around you are undulating, and there are treacherous-looking waves in the distance. Fix your eyes here, because I’m never going to change. By the time those waves reach you, they will have shrunk to the proportions that I designed. I am always beside you, helping you face today’s waves.
