Felicity lives
Stare into speckled night sky
Atmospheric space 

As the Sahara dunes pile around us, our caravan weaves between still waves. The rust color of the sand reflects into the gaseous air and a green mix comes back down to us. It lives among us and we among it.

I don’t trust the strangers here with me in the middle of the world. 

The green gases and deep blue from the sky seep together into the densest night I’ve ever witnessed. I grip the rope tightly and painfully sway as the camel steps and sinks into the sand. Shifting from one side to the other, I lose balance while staring up into the abyss. I am tired and the darkness is difficult for us all to press through.

The night draws on as my eyelids get closer without me noticing. It isn’t until they clamp down on a view of the horizon that I realize the complete darkness. I’m too far in my own head or too lost in this cold desert sphere. This is what I’ve imagined when I lay awake at night.
