The problems we think we have and the hardships we face now; pain is not relative. It needs to be held in a constant proportion to the goals we all live for. I write from the inside of a cell. The image of my face is reflected on the glass pane that covers one of the doors of a Gestapo detainment block. Two artists have been at work on this medium. The prison walls have the dingy defiled characteristics only Time has the patience to craft. The other man inside, someone whom I’ve grown to admire, has left his mark over Time’s signature. Letters, words, calendars, and drawings are engraved now in both serious and cynical detail for the world to see.\

Time is torture and it is more than the physical torment this man endured. Time does not feel fatigue, Time has no schedule. Time, the ruthless limiter, pushes you from moments of happiness and enjoys the slowness of misery. You stand in the middle of the dark space you have for a mind. The dimensions are your choosing, but ultimately the measurements around you are irrelevant; the shade meets you wherever you choose to stand. He or she, the androgynous phantom, approaches the noisy iron and wood door at the front. The door cracks. You see light race past the tall silhouette towards you. Burning in your mind, burning in your temples, you close your eyelids until your lashes start to filter it out. The being arches its back to walk through the frame, it closes the door, and is lost for a moment in the darkness of your consciousness. Your eyes, now open, are relieved not to know its whereabouts. You don’t want to know and at the same time you do. At least you think you do.\
 
And so you do. In dull golden garb, a footsteps into the white light around you, followed by its torso and countenance, filled by with shadow. These moments pass slowly. These movements, the steps toward you, take years. Your breath fluctuates. In your emptiness, you gasp for air and in consolation you relieve your seams before they tear. Cloth dangles from the arms of the creature. It begins to move up toward you. It defies the gravity that pushes it down and in a way that is too fluid for the gaunt and lanky body parts in front of you. Its boney black hand settles on your shoulder. You stare for a moment, chained by fear, and look into the ambiguous visage facing you now. What barely resembles a face stares through your eyes into the back of your skull. Its calloused and rough hand slides to the base of your neck. You feel it on your skin rising up to your head. Nail leads finger into ear. You’ve gone unconscious and time moves on without you.\

I stand at this door and see a face reflecting back at me in the spaces between iron bars. I can only see the bottom of his nose to the top of his shoulders in this small gap. There is not enough detail to tell clearly, but it causes me to question on which side of the door it is that I stand. I am connected to this man although I don’t recognize him through the window. I know him through his writing, his carvings and this connects us. He writes to create a world outside of his own. He writes to turn time away and for reasons only he can truly understand. I write to capture the thoughts and the details of the moments time takes away from me. I want to remember the way I think now.\

Although our words are different, both escape the threats of death and traps of time. You learn from me and I’ve learned from you. What’s more, I’ve been inspired by you. I admire you although I don’t know you. Similar and so different. I see your cause and I carry the message forward. I carry your mind and your nameless intelligence. Your pride and your devout servitude are relevant especially now. The man turns to leave the window and we go our separate ways.
