We don’t have to know how to do it all, there are others who can help us. I’ve learned to be more patient with myself since new skills come with time, and with people.

Maybe all it took is that god-forsaken public transportation officer to check my metro card and then kick me off the bus, impatiently reminding me that I do in fact speak French. He knows I understand him, although I don’t want to admit it. Yeah, I speak French, but I didn’t pay for my metro fair and now I’m trying to get out of a ticket.
