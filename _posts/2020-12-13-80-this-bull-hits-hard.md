Life doesn’t get easier; you get better. Today feels like a bull barreling straight into my chest. Each hit comes one after another and swells after impact. I hold back every excuse because I know that now is the time to buck up and make positive changes. I want this, I’m hungry for it, so I will make it happen. I got the acceptance letter to the program; classes will get figured out; cue visions of money flying out of my pockets. I will take this time with the bulls and use it to my advantage. This one is mine, beneath my hand, and at the tips of my fingers. 

– 

I’m conflicted. I’m waiting on too many emails, depending on too many people, and yet these five days have been the most productive of my entire trip. I don’t have the ability to control the other side, such as the hiring manager or the admissions counselor. Nevertheless, I move myself according to modern American standards. 
I will set myself up for either side of ‘success.’ Blacked out or white light, I’ll be there to make the most of it.
