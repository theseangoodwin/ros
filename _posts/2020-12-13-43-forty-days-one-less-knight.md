“The purpose of Lent is to keep alive in our consciousness and in our life the fact that being Christian can only take the form of becoming a Christian ever anew. It is not an event, but a process requiring constant practice. If individuals are to become Christians, they need the strength to overcome, they need the power to stand fast against the natural tendency to let themselves be carried along. Only where such effort is expended is there life; where the effort ceases, life too ceases.” 

—Benedict XVI
