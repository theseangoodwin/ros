I’m not expecting the ride back to Marseille to be any better than it was on the way down. I’m prepping for the worst. I collect the last 5 euros from my pockets and set out to find dinner. As I make my way from store to store, I collect some seeded green grapes for €2.15, two Granny Smith apples for €1.15, and a crusty round loaf of bread for €1.20. I celebrate this small victory and welcome back the leftover 50 centimes to my pocket.\

My path leads me across Barcelona’s Arc de Triomfe. With time to spare before my bus leaves at midnight, I step beneath the arch and into an area outlined by palm trees, ornate brass lampposts with more warm orange lights, and concrete benches. <a class="E41_I1">The rectangle-shaped plaza is filled with strolling couples, a few skateboarders, and dogs running free as their owners take back the daily tourist’s haven.</a> I claim a bench, take off my shoes, cross my legs, and have my meal, ending the trip in a similar manner as I started it. This time there are a few differences, however, and the greatest is acknowledged as I speak to myself, panning across the docile cityscape.

You are not asked to internalize the changes I inspire within you now. You are not asked to hold onto the victories you win here. You are called to act on them. You will build from stone and mind and they will flock to celebrate our victory-- interdependence in the flesh. You will make a monument that will stand for generations to come. The people that feel the least important carve their names onto your walls to feel remembered. These are the ones you seek to change. You give them this immaterial worth through the materials of your choosing. You will be the way for others to reach greater fulfillment. You will be remembered after you leave.\

Only timidity keeps you from achieving your dreams. When you see the needy, your mind is the only obstacle keeping you from making a difference. I require your commitment to others and I, your conscience, won’t relent until you’ve stepped up to these obligations. I pull on your heart every time you turn down their suffering. You can change others; I’ve deepened your love and you can change their world. \

Tonight you see what I mean. In darkness and frustration, a man with no teeth and no English will approach you. As you speak, he understands. Searching for something irrelevant, you are met with an opportunity to see the duality of our lives. Our choices can divide us. Some can turn their noses up and lift their cigarettes to their pursed faces. They err on worldly expectations and are callous. Ignorance is the most poignant form of degradation. Do not ignore those in need because you are meant to make the difference. You clear the smoke pushed out by selfish lips and show them love. Take this man in your arms, meet him with what you have, and lead him where you will. Change the beggar and the stone-cold snobs.\

Get close, get personal, get big, and be remembered. Memories of love change lives.\

The bus on the way back to Marseille was just as bad as I expected. With a crooked neck and aching back, I made the commute to my apartment from the middle of the city. My first class of the week is in five hours.
