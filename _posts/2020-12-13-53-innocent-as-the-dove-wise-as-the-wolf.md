Home sweet hole. I stare down the stagnant cave of vagrancy. I shiver at its depth. I am astounded as I peer over the edge into the black and my insides collapse. I realize that there is some capacity for my imagination to make up the dimensions of the hole, but imagination spawns from truth. This truth lies in the similarities between my days and those of the impoverished. The only difference between tourism and homelessness is the amount of money in your pocket.
 
I arrive in a city, take to the streets, and am eager to experience the day for what it is worth. I am look forward to solving the problems that come my way. I step down from the train, the bus, the plane, the whatever, and the sun is always shining. I venture to the hostel and for a period of time I am lost. I have a map, but I am by no means found. I do not know where exactly I will sleep tonight, but I know that there is a place reserved for me. This feeling of certainty is the fine line between the two occupations of time. It is this sample of unsurety that allows me to know the complications that come through doing nothing.
 
How can I better understand life on the streets than to put myself there? I envisioned myself asleep on the ground. I seek clarity for these visions because ambiguity makes me uncomfortable. I seek the innocence of the dove and the wisdom of the wolf.
