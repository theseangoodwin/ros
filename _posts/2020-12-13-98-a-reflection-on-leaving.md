Today has been my last day in Marseille. I cleaned my room and gathered my bags, now much more filled than they were when I arrived. I’ve packed my belongings around an elk antler that is slightly longer and taller than the size of my duffle bag. I got it from Paris and lovingly carried this oblong pointy thing back to my apartment by way of trains and buses, where it was ceremoniously rested atop my wardrobe. Now the antler nearly bursts the seams of my bag. I can only hope it will make it through security and back to the U.S. This evening I’ll leave Luminy and make my way to the edge of Marseille for my flight out of the country. My plane leaves at six in the morning; public transportation won’t be able to get me there that early, so I’ve decided to enjoy a night at the airport.

Until then however, I’ll spend my last few hours with my closest friends down the street. We make dinner, spend time reminiscing and laughing, and make plans to get back together in the States. I don’t really know what these friendships will look like back home. I don’t know if we’ll actually get back together, but I want to. I have cherished our time because the months we’ve spent together were radical moments in our lives. Our relationships are unique, unexpected, and empowering. Taiwo, Keha, and I sit on the balcony after dinner and watch the fluid sky change colors and set too quickly. We laugh through our evident sadness until the coastal breeze makes it too cold to stay outside. We bring the dishes in to clean, shutting the sliding glass door behind us.

I look back to where I began and am proud of my progress. I turn back to the glass door only to see the reflections of the wall, the foyer, and the front door to the apartment now behind me. I realize now that the only direction to go is forward.
The twins walk me to the familiar covered bench on the side of the street, and when the bus arrives, I leave.
