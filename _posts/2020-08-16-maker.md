<blockquote>“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. <span class="blackletter">Our deepest fear</span> is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, ‘Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?’ <a>Actually, who are you not to be?</a>... There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.... And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, <span class="blackletter">our presence automatically liberates others.</span>”</blockquote>
