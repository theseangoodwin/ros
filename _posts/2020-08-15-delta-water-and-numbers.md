The nighttime has, for many months now, been losing its civility. Before I leave for the Vieux Port, I had not gotten enough sleep. Nerves, linguistics, and discomfort kept me awake. I closed my eyes and still they moved from side to side, as if I more than imagine the things in my head.

I open my eyes, the sun is high, and I begin the new day.
