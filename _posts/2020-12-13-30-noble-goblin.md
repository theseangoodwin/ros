Aldo video-called me two nights ago for an interview. He was gathering quotes for a print design project. 

“What are you afraid of?” he asked. 

The look in his eye wasn’t typical and it was clear that these answers meant something to both of us. I fear the things I don’t know. Language barriers, the ‘first’ of many experiences, and the ways people will react. They are all beyond my grasp and out of my control. I know my capabilities and after perceiving the problems ahead, I prepare myself as well as I can before the next obstacle overwhelms me. I grow because I fear being at the mercy of the waves. They stop for no one and I hate banking on special treatment.
