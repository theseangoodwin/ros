Over the course of the past year, I’ve read through this book quite a few times. I’ve thought about the moments these words capture. I think about the wine, the small apartment, the dim desk lamp I wrote beneath, and about the wine some more. I think about the journals, the tickets, the maps I burned through, and then about where I began. I am there again but this time it looks different, and it feels different, and it will never be the same now that I know what it’s like to live another way.

I’ve learned many things in this process of writing. These are a few: 

1. I’ve learned how much harder I make things in my head. Getting on a plane and finding my way through the bizarre streets of a foreign country, mentally converting currency, and financing and surviving a trip is difficult. Difficult, but not impossible. Pushing myself to experience something great seemed like a fantasy until I did exactly that. It seemed impossible until I made the experience priority, until I committed myself to a dream and made steps toward achieving it. I gained an unprecedented sense of ability and freedom. I realized big fears were unfounded and that I am more capable than I feel comfortable giving myself credit for.

2. I’ve learned how tough it is to return home. Our familiar hometown is never as endearing as it is when we can’t go back. Sooner or later, our return will be accompanied by well-intended friends asking what’s next and where we’re headed. Geographically? Metaphorically? I don’t know what they mean. Those first few days back from France when I still lived out of a suitcase started to feel like a bad crash after a high-on-life experience. I’ve learned that when people ask what is next for me, I can find comfort in the unknown. I didn’t know what tomorrow looked like in Europe or what great stories would come from this first year back in the U.S. I don’t know what’s coming next, but today is almost over and I still have work to do.

3. I’ve learned that it’s important to appreciate what you can’t document. There are things that photos won’t do justice to. I refused to take photographs of certain sites, rooms, and moments because of the intimacy and respect some experiences demand. Imagine the difference pulling out my camera would have made in speaking with Ed and Danny. I refused to take photos inside sanctuaries because I know that their nature is not congruent with the celebrity of photography. I can do them no justice and I wouldn’t dare try. I’ve learned to stop trying to preserve and eternalize things. I grew in my appreciation of small fleeting moments and became more sensitive of the details. I’ve learned to cherish the invisible gusts of wind that send chills down my spine. I’ll never forget the chattering cold night. I now have appreciation for the sunrise not as it looks, but as it feels — as I experience it and as it is perceived. No camera will ever capture those feelings.

4. I’ve learned to listen closely to nonverbal communication. When I gestured my way for directions (mostly to restrooms), I realized body language counts for so much of how we understand one each other. I became largely aware of my body language when it was the only way I could get things done. This has allowed me to more intentionally communicate with my body and face.

5. I’ve learned to listen even more closely to instinct. I remember leading a group through the treacherous alleys of the medina in Fes at night. It was very dark. Never before had I leaned so far into my gut than in moments like those. It’s much more important to rely on instinct in those circumstances because you have no other choice. When you learn to trust yourself, the voice inside starts growing larger. I became so familiar with it that I was able to predict my decisions before threats were presented. I became more aware of my decision-making style and am able to make choices more in line with my natural instinct.

6. Say what you mean, mean what you say. If the answer is ‘yes,’ say so and just that.

7. I’ve learned the appeal of utility. I remember putting bags and bags of my belongings on the plane to return to the U.S. I remember paying a great deal of extra money getting them back over. I look at the clothes I bought while abroad and realize that bringing them home was not worth their value now. I’ve begun wearing much simpler clothes everyday, such as neutral colors to match and quality pieces that last. How easy it would have been to have adopted simple t-shirts and layers while abroad. I would have had more room to bring back artifacts that I wouldn’t have outgrown or torn a hole in. 

8. The people who become most important in your life will come in unexpected ways and times. There are two kinds of friendships. The first you form out of convenience. The second you maintain despite inconvenient time zones, work schedules, and everything else. From what I’ve seen, the second matter more. You can’t predict where your friends will come from and so I try to be as open as possible. You can’t set out with the intention of finding friends because friendships just happen, and they mean more than makes sense. Despite time and location, the value of great friendships never change. 

9. I’ve learned that a comfort zone is only an illusionary wall. There is no need to break the wall down. Just take a deep breath in and, with confidence, take the first step through.

10. I’ve learned that the way in which I was raised is not the only way. The cultural dynamics of Europe are much more far-reaching than the limited American perspective. When I immersed myself in another culture, I realized that the standards I was holding myself to were subjective and could be challenged. 

11. I’ve learned to be like Ferdinand. I would rather stop and smell the flowers than furiously check off cities from a list. The ‘must sees’ for one person aren’t the same for another. You aren’t any more or less travelled than someone else because you haven’t seen Milan or Amsterdam yet. There is always time to explore. If you want to, you will make it happen.

12. I discovered what I need more of in my regular life. The places I most wanted to visit were telling of my personality. I learned that I deeply desire to be around people, despite spending most of my time travelling alone. Even though I convinced myself that it would be cool and understated to be introverted, I know now that I have extroverted tendencies. When I figured out what the most vital aspects of my personality were, I learned to incorporate them into my daily life even when I wasn’t traveling. 

13. I learned what I desire to return to and where home is. By experiencing bittersweet pangs of sadness, I learned that my closest friends are more important to me that I care to admit. I’ve learned that I am deeply invested in my friendships, and that I thrive on relationship-building, community, and vulnerability. I was surprised by who and what I missed when I was away. Home takes on a new meaning, sometimes even multiple meanings. Home is a country, home is a person, home is a place, or a restaurant, or a community.

14. I’ve learned that there is always a reason not to go. If you’re searching for a reason, you’ll find one, or many.

15. I’ve learned exactly how little I know. I don’t know what I don’t know, and that in and of itself is a boggling thing to say. I was surprised by the number of places I had never heard of, the concepts for which English had no words, and the ways of speaking that I can’t pick up no matter how many times or how slowly I ask for them to be repeated. I am in awe of the knowledge of the world.

16. I’ve learned to love being alone. Whether I was by myself for an eight-hour flight, eating lunch at a café, shopping in town, or the only person in the room who spoke English, I was challenged and rewarded by the experience. I learned to better understand myself after I removed all other elements of familiarity. I stepped away from my family, friends, goals, culture, career, and instead focused on myself and my day. I learned to love every day and respect it as an adventure. 
I learned to love the life I lead. No one will facilitate a perfect lifetime itenerary for me and I refuse to wait for others to show me the world. Through my travels, I realized that I am responsible for the destination of my journey.
