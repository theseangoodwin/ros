I know I am so hollow 
just an empty cave 
pit of my heart, dark 
then treachery came 

fear dark 
wake in time 
red eyes to realize
 
there’s a safe sound within your voice 
I get up here close because I want to know 
what it’s like to be yours and all for you
 
teach me to become love
 
slowly I start to burn 
a small flame 
came and pushed back the black putting it in its place

I know I’m so hollow 
an empty cave 
pit of my heart, dark, then majesty came 

fear God 
open your heart 
your eyes are mine 
when I realize
 
there’s a safe space between your arms 
I get up, stand up, because I want you to know 
that I choose to be yours and all for you
 
teach me to become love
