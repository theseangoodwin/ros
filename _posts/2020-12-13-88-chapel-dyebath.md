death, pattern, fault
come to us all 

shape, pattern, color

god cut God because you can
repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating 
worship, pattern, fall
death to us all

gone in the blink of an eye
everything I had fell behind me 
I move forward, changing, because I have to

into the dyebath, I start down
into the murk liquid mixed with bird shit 
it stains my legs, it clings to my skin
claims it’ll never let go, even after death

the color marks me
proof to see who I was and who I will be

I lower myself in to my neck
until my neck is slowly, slowly, 
the final divide between the past and the present
 
The red meets my eyes, everything red
Red like I’ve never seen before

I submerge and I submit
