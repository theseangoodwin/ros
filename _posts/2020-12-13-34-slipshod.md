Here we all are, a makeshift group of three Germans, two Finns, an Australian, and two Americans, cramped in a hotel room. The windows are open to the chilly red night sky and I hear the street sounds below. I’m cooking with Lucas while Brent fills glasses of wine across the two joined tables we pushed together. It’s loud and there’s music in the background. 

I found my way in with this group while writing at the port in Marseille. They are all kind enough and have personalities that pique my interest. Tomorrow we will ski the French Alps together. The mountains loom in the distance. For now, I will enjoy a wide conversation that is friendly enough, but laced with unnecessarily sharp opinions. 

Strong patriotism exists, but I’ve not been convinced that it’s warranted at such an emphatic level. Maybe this is just my ignorance shining through.
