The hardest part is arriving and now I am finally here. I’ve worked diligently to make my own way to this country and now it is reciprocating back to me. It’s carved out a part to call my own. It makes me feel safe, and allows me</br> 
to recover after I’ve given the day all I have. While there undoubtedly are things around me that will fall apart, I now know that even the space above my bed is helping me to build my dreams.
