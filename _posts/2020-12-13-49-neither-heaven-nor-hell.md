If I had it my way, the selfishness my eyes seek would take me away while my soul tells me to turn back. Back and forth, between the two ends and always in the middle. Here in this gradient plane, I believe I am alone. I can’t bring myself to commit to either side at any point soon. A bankrupt soul for a happy heart? Can’t the two coexist? Isn’t it possible for black and white to create balance, repetition, movement, scale, and beauty? My insides aren’t any different than others’. At least they shouldn’t be.

I open myself up, take a blade deep into my fat stomach and pull it across. It is a division that becomes gaping insight to the things that make me. I stare down past my chest and watch a gray curdled mush slowly spill out and into my lap.
