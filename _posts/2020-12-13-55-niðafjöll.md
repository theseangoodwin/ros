I believe that creativity is not reserved for who we typically call the ‘creative’. Creativity is not related to skill. It is not related to passion or only the aesthetic value of a thing. \

My definition of creativity has largely been formed by the work of Brené Brown, a social psychologist and researcher. In 2013, Brown offered the following statement: Vulnerability is the birthplace of creativity, innovation, and change. And derived from that is my working definition of creativity: Creativity is the combination of vulnerability, a medium, and action.\

Creativity describes the transformation of an idea to an outcome. The process assumes the vulnerability of the maker and bravery in offering something via some medium to the world. That offering, be it performance, physical art, a thesis, a political platform, or business strategy etc., will take some form and be critiqued by its audience. If not by others, then certainly by the maker themself. The point being, that where there was once nothing, a person took it upon themself to make something—creation.
