I don’t want to be here because there is quite a distance between what I want and where I currently am. I’m tired of waiting to be happy with my decisions, my educational track, and my career. Just because I think that Marketing and Graphic Design go hand in hand does not mean that they actually do or will. I don’t foresee myself being happy at the start of my career because of the expectations employers have of recent graduates. This cross compatibility sounds great in my head, but I can’t see the path I will take out into the real world.\
 
Conscientiousness does not equate to clarity. Just because I tell myself with conviction that success will come doesn’t mean that I am anywhere close to seeing that goal through. Even in the right place under the light of the right idea, the future professional I want to become can’t tell me what to do. For all I know, I could have bought a ticket way up at the top of the theatre and wouldn’t be able to see through the silhouettes in front of me.
