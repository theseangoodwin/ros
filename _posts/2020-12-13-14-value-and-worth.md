out with the old 
you’ve grown 
or so you say you have
 
the news does not shock you 
your skin is too thick 
the crevice is too deep


and as you stand at the edge 
it takes your breath from your chest 



take back every word 
in the off chance I’m dead wrong 
tell me what else is out there
 
in with the new it is here 
like it or not 
make some space between 
those pretty little ears 
it’s all you’ve got left in your head



the flux and the waves to a world receding 
between the lines and outside of our minds 
and I’ve nothing left to lose 



prove to me I’m a liar 
prove to me I’m alive 



take this place back to black and white 
because I’m tired of the grey 
one worn out scene with no distinction,
I just want to see you
 
can these legs prove to me 
we’ve overtaken most everything
 
for real, for hate, 
for the lost and the saints 
for the love of a night, 
and a barren sunrise
 
take back every word 
in the off chance I’m dead wrong 
tell me what else is out there
 
prove to me I’m a liar 
prove to me I’m alive
