We are never finished, not until we die. And even then, are we? Who we are changes day by day, little by little. That’s why people say, “I haven’t changed.” Because these changes are so small that they aren’t noticed when they happen and, therefore aren’t perceived. Usually only after a hole has been completely filled do we give ourselves credit for the work we’ve done. Those who truly stop changing are to be pitied. Encourage them to work again. To be deprived of the ability to grow can be a side effect of the human burden. Push malignancy, self-deprecation, inadequacy, opposition, doubt, amateurism, and the always-important ego aside. See space not as what it isn’t, but what it could be. Embrace your ability to create something lasting for the world to one day stand before and look foolish gawking at.
