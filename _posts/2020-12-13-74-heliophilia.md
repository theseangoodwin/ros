Through out the day, I recall the details of the previous night. I realize that if I want the life I imagine in my head, if I want it until the day I die, Iâ€™m going to have to fight for it. The dark will try to take it. The drunk will try to play with it. The cold will bite and the headlights will stare me down. I better not lose my dream. The time in the sun is well worth the hours in the dark.
