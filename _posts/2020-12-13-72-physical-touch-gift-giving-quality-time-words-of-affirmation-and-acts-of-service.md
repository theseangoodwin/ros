I look forward to the conversations, hugs, and stories I’ll have when I get back home. I miss physically being there for my loved ones. When I kiss the cheeks of these new friends in France, it doesn’t mean as much as it would with the people I separated myself from. As incredible as these new friends are, they are sometimes only painful reminders of how far away I am from home.
 
I realize now that the ‘baggage’ I brought with me is not as negative as it sounds. I left with myself in mind and had a striking openness to the world. The life I have is good. It is so good, in fact, that I want to be there more than here. Granted, I’m in my cold apartment writing for an underwhelming economics class. I know I won’t feel the same on the weekend or when I get on a plane to some new city.
