I know we won’t survive 
I swear we won’t make it out alive
 
be afraid 
don’t you know what lies underneath 
the fabric that never quite covered it? 

your feral mind will decide to let it all go 
I can see right through your empty facade
 
have we all just gone to the dogs? 
it’s not safe but we’re still moving on 
and those so-called diamond minds continue to 
lead us three steps back

have we all just gone to the dogs? 
I know they are going to leave nothing for anyone
so if you don’t mind 

go and hide your darling pearls 
collapse, will your body fail you? 
collapse into yourself 
now you’ve caved in 
the same thing we all do

and he said, she said 
that belief was a cemetery 
it’s a shallow hole where suckers lay 
and I won’t waste my time with it 
no, I will not take any part of it 

so if you don’t mind 

go and hide your darling pearls 
collapse, will your body fail you? 
collapse into yourself 
now you’ve caved in 
the same thing we always do
