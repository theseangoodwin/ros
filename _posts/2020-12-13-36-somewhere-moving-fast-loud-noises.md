Right now, the night races past me on this high-speed train back to Marseille. The surroundings alternate between wide open moonlit fields and condensed black within tight concrete tunnels. The wind pierces my ears when we dive under the countryside hills. There is intense pressure on my eardrums as we enter and exit. My eyes are itchy. My throat is dry. I’m tired. I’ve been skiing, eating, laughing, and becoming more thankful for sleep day by day. I’ve been anxious and reluctantly annoyed, which means I’ve made friends as well as some acquaintances. I’m proud of the way I’ve handled myself throughout each of these situations.

I’m excited to get back to my apartment and unpack my souvenirs from Grenoble. They include the pile of emerald green broken glass, a well-designed 2014–2015 tourism guide, the winter issue of BeStreet magazine, evergreen from the top of the French Alps, ivy from the base of the Bastille, and several other smaller papers and posters from around the city and the Musée Dauphinois. 

Another tunnel... 

The shrill sound numbs my brain and breaks my concentration. I wish I had been able to find a gift for my mother because seasonal French retail sales are happening now. I’ve only got a few days until they end. The dark night and romantic speckled stars pass from my view.

“Blah blah blah, Marsayuh, saunt sharl”, breaks over the cabin intercom.
