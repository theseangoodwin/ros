<a class="E38_I1">There’s something special about a moment witnessed only by you in a public space.</a> If you blink, you miss it, and you may never have a chance to see it again. A moment like this happened as Becca and I sat on the bench having our breakfast. The washed-out blue morning sky slowly brightened and came into its own. At the apex of the sky’s change, the streetlights in the park flicker off and, as if a curtain were raised, we were suddenly part of a much bigger and more colorful world again. I noticed the bikes, the dogs on leashes, and the man cleaning the concrete outside his store. Our conversation stopped for a time as we took in the change to our environment. It was a special moment that won’t soon leave my mind; an open invitation from the city, letting me know that the day had officially begun.
